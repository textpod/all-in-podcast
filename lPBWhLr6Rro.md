Date: 10/08/2021

Duration: 1 hours, 23 minutes, 11 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

Our daughter's head is dropped because the Our doctors she she felt the head and she was like yeah, it's it's a chaimouth whose head has gotten bigger yours or your daughters What do you mean quit your day job sex sex that didn't quite land Trying out material Total flow we are not in rhythm, you know why it's mercury retrograde our 50th episode is gonna suck because of this here we go 3 2 All right, the Facebook whistleblower hearings occurred and Facebook Where's your hey everybody? Hey everybody? Hey everybody? Hey everybody welcome to another episode of the all in podcast episode 50.

We made it to 50 Nobody expected us to make it here. We are we've made it and everybody is Thrilled to be here with you and thank you for the support over the first 50 episodes one episode closer to getting canceled Episode close man. How great would it be to be canceled? I'd never have to work again. Oh That'd be wonderful. Okay, so Francis Haugen revealed herself on Sunday night on 60 minutes and then appeared You're unbelievable Retrograde mercury retro retro gay. I'm all fuck doesn't the audience know us by now after 50 episodes We really have to put him three two one with us again this week is the Rain Man himself David sacks and The Queen of Kenwa David Friedberg.

I love the intro of course the dictator Chamoff polyopetita and I'm your boy J. Cal Sacks, I got to say I think I think your AUM is positively correlated with the bags under your eyes If you mean it's getting bigger you're Dragging you down that's where you're hiding all that Solana in your fucking under your eyes You better clear that Solana position what's your lockup 24 months fuck no, he's trying to sell it to me and text message We're negotiating discounts. I just had the whole thing up I'm holding you think I buy a million dollars of anything without a discount everything is a discount Everything's discounted you want to clear that position in an LLC.

Are you saying I got a billion dollars of Solana? No, bro. I'm saying I have one, but you know, I brought it at a discount, but you're holding correct Ish. Yeah If something appreciate at what point is the appreciation in an asset that you've invested in early something you need to You know at least clear our position of the lock in a win. I mean What's enough a hundred X 500 X you got a at some point bank a win, right? Well, I think you have to put things in a bucket of like is it an investment or is it something that Represents an idea that you love so much if it's the latter you should never sell if it's the former.

Yeah, you got a man It's risk and you're rather, you know, is it a trade or is it something you want to own? by the way, let me just clean this up because Solana was not a direct investment for us. What we did is we invested in in a crypto Venture firm called multi coin capital. This is back in 2017 We realized like crypto was becoming like a full time job for us as a total rabbit hole And we were like we don't have time to figure out this like 24 seven trading stuff But we met Kyle and Tushar who were these two young guys We met them through Vinnie Lingham actually and they were creating multi coin capital And we actually invested we gave them a million bucks at a 20 cap to help set up their firm And then we invested in their data both a venture fund and a hedge fund and they were like the first money into Solana So that fund I mean, it's like a hundred X fund.

It's just like bonkers crazy And so as a result of that we are Indirect beneficiaries of this huge increase in Solana it will end up being about you know a billion dollars of I Think Solana for us in terms of returns But but it's the multi coin guys to determine the trading decisions on that. Yeah, and so people who don't know Solana is a programmable You know Ethereum competitor, I guess and it's at 50 billion dollars or so market cap. It was trading on a dollar Not long ago and now it's at 164. It's an Ethereum competitor basically for you know smart contract platform And there's a lot of people I'd say smart money in Silicon Valley who are betting on a flippening Where Solana could ultimately overtake? Ethereum as the preferred platform, but even if it doesn't overtake Ethereum at it, you know It's the number eight cryptocurrency right now, you know, it could go there's a lot of people betting It'll go to number three or you know, what have you Additionally, it is a fraction of a penny for a transaction And it can do many more track sessions than a theorem.

So it's you know, technically Should be much cheaper if you're buying NFTs right now. You're probably spending, you know tens of dollars You know in fees on Ethereum, whereas if you did those same NFTs, which some people are starting to do on Solana They would cost a fraction of a penny correct David or Strumat Yeah, I think the the platform is known for being a faster cheaper, you know blockchain really really congratulations and if Vinny Langems Instagram is any indication he did pretty well because his Instagram suddenly turned into a world tour on private jets Yeah, he like which which which island should I buy and well like Vinny was sort of like a I don't think he's full time in multi coin But he was sort of a venture partner to Kyle and Tushar and he helped set them up.

This is back in 2017 He helped bring us in as the first investors and I mean for us it was sort of a founder bet combined with a Like a team like sort of a space bet like we knew the cryptocurrency's were starting to be traded 24 seven We knew it required more of like a hedge fund skill set than what we had and So we made you know, we made a bet on those guys and man That's one of the nice strategies, right sacks is if you are LP in new Fun managers, which I've done a couple of times now you get to learn from them And basically dive into a data set of a new market, right? I mean, it's like one of the nice things about being an LP in a fund is you can place a small bet whether it's 50k or 500k or 5 million whatever it is you you get like this meta education of an entire sector, correct? Yeah, but I think you know, we didn't do it to learn from them Although we have it's more that we realized that crypto was like it's a becoming such a rabbit hole like it We realized we would either need to do crypto full time as a fund or we would need to like partner with people who actually did Yeah You see that with like a lot of VC firms now is they're creating like specialized crypto funds or at least they have specialized crypto partners There's so much to know about the crypto world.

It's a hard thing to invest in unless you're like totally focused on it I've struggled with that like I've tried to go deep on a couple Topics and like I realized holy shit I've been in this for like four to six hours just trying to learn this stuff and I'm not like there And then I feel uncertain about making any decisions. I I totally get it I mean you got to have folks like working on this and the pace is changing So rapidly you really need to kind of be up to date on what's next When you look at crypto people use the word crypto as if it's like that's all there is totally crypto Computing yeah, right eCash cryptography You know financial modeling or building new economic systems to mouth.

There's business model innovation. There's technology innovation There's economic innovation. It's a computing innovation. Yeah infrastructure infrastructure hardware. I mean there's there's quite a lot of Layers of activity to mouth. Are you spending time in crypto yourself or do you have people doing it for you or how are you? Yeah, we have look we have we have a lot of it a Lot of a lot of everything So yeah, we have things but do you go deep yourself to mouth? Like how do you spend enough time to really get up to speed on all the goings on I? Cherry pick and I snipe and opportunities where I get intellectually curious and jump in But a lot of the credit goes to my team there's a couple folks that spend a lot of their time in it and You know, we've we've had a couple people Do extremely well For us, you know similar similar to David story back in the day You know I invested in Barry Silver and DCG market Barry Silver.

Yeah, and you know DCG is now I don't know. I'm guessing a $20 billion company Maybe more I don't know how does it mechanically work with your team? They they are investigating opportunities And then they come to you and bring you you know, hey, we'll do a meeting and I'm going to share four with you and then you say Yeah, I'm feeling the phone with you basically go deep go deep when something shows up to my no So so basically what happens is they have carte blanche to do whatever they want and what they're typically doing is they're working with entrepreneurs to seed projects and you know to to To get projects off the ground and then at some point when those when those projects become deep large enough Then they'll issue tokens and you know, we'll get a certain allocation of those tokens and so we've done that for you know, call it I don't know Some number of projects that we think are valuable then along the way, you know, they'll have certain views on Bitcoin They'll have certain views on Ethereum.

They'll have certain views on Solana and we'll make capital allocation decisions They tend to have the ability to do whatever they want And then what I tend to do is just think about when it gets above like it to me I need to see the chance to make at least you know in the rough justice around, you know 500 to a billion dollars and then I'll get involved But otherwise they just kind of run the whole thing. Let me ask you guys a question here You know when you look at the market caps of these projects, it seems like Things are changing Cardona or Cardona is number three now and And tether still remains number five XRP still number six, but so long encourage people to not look at it like that I think looking at it.

It's a rank list betrays what it is So, you know, I'll give you a simple example Let's like that compare the fate of two projects or actually right now. There's a distributed form of Discord that's being built Discord the chat app. Yeah, in a completely distributed way with an integrated crypto wallet because if you look at discord It's really two cohorts of people. There's gaming and there's crypto, right? So the two big ones. Yeah, so, you know That's an example of a really interesting Product that has some real potential then if you look at something like diesel diesel is a decentralized social Programming framework then if you look at something like helium that's completely about building a large distributed You know connection of Unwraps to the internet so internet connectivity So those are three completely different ideas with three completely different paths to success If to invest in those tokens you you have to believe in three totally different sets of things Yes, so to look at it on a rank list and just buy something because it's cheap is No, no, no, no, no, it's stupid.

Don't know that wasn't really my question My question was you know, we we have an extraordinary number of the public who've invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum as number one and number two and those projects Feel maybe stagnant when compared to the dynamism of what I'll call You know, the projects launched in the last three or four years because they're at a different number But you're talking about confusing again. That's what I mean Those are layer one protocols, right? Meaning they are at the core substrate of how all of crypto is going to work Then you have these other projects that build on top of these things in different ways or build around them So my point is if you don't have if you don't want to take the time to understand Which layer twos you want to own and which layer ones you want to own and why I think you're much better off I understand your point my my point is ETF or something else because there are there are ways to own these things So for example David David Solana is does not need Ethereum to exist So my point is do we do we see a day when this you know, the past decade has been about Bitcoin and Ethereum Do we see a day when maybe people stop buying those and start buying these new ones anything's possible? But here's here's the evolution of our thinking.

I mean the first step was realizing okay, we need to own Bitcoin why because You know, there's now enough evidence where what like a decade or more than a decade into this Nobody has been able to essentially counterfeit a Bitcoin. It is you know, new money It is it is better money So if you but it's so I'm not convinced people right now of the argument for Bitcoin But if you believe in it that's sort of the first step is you realize you really need to have one to two percent of your portfolio In Bitcoin in the event that fiat money sort of becomes debased and eventually move to crypto Then you realize well wait a second Bitcoin is just one application of block chains There's a bunch of applications of block chains.

So maybe we need to own not just sort of you know Digital money, but we also need to own the underlying blockchain platform And that leads you to Ethereum Then you realize that there's a bunch of competitors to Ethereum and it's still very early days and one of those guys might ultimately Displace Ethereum as a blockchain platform Then you realize that there's all these applications on top of all these block chains And so, you know, the conclusion I come to after all of that is I can't figure all this out and well Maybe I could if I was willing to go back to school and like make this a full time job Which I just don't want to do I mean I'm lazy and that's why I focus on SaaS like that's what I know You're gonna be a star.

Yeah, like I'm not gonna reinvent myself. It's like you playing hold them versus PLO, right? Right exactly. So but this is why we partner with multi coin capital So what I would just say is like the idea that you as an individual investor are gonna like, you know pick off the one Cryptocurrency here or there to invest in I mean that's gonna be a lottery I would I would find a manager basically who is really good who has a track record to understands this stuff our approach is to hire very young Extremely technical computer scientists and mathematicians to basically do the work That's that's working Yeah, and you know one of the things that I think these guys do and the reason why it is very helpful for the computer scientists is These are all open source projects.

So they go look at the repos Just go look it go look at what you see the changes being made and this is like she realizes only 12 people who are actively working on Solana in the but you need to you need to look at all the code check ins Seven of them work for Solana. You need to look at all the code check ins You need to look at the velocity of the code check in yes So you can see like how many projects are being created on these platforms the white papers are also really exceptional like if you if you read These white papers they are they're there.

They're really incredibly thoughtful and and well written and you can really understand what their goals are and You can make some informed decisions there But again, if you're not going to be in the business of being in this ecosystem because I think David's right Everything is moving so fast What's successful today could be just a dog tomorrow and vice versa that I think speculating in this market will Not only will it be super volatile but more than likely you're going to lose all your money So I would encourage people to not speculate in crypto I would encourage you to figure out an elegant way of having an abstracted bet if to the extent you care about it And by the way in the UK for example, there are ways where you can own publicly traded mutual funds That give you exposure to this.

It's just like yes. Yes Yeah, but there are mutual funds of credit Do the work find these mutual funds just own those things and let somebody else do the hard work because this is too It's too hard. Some of the other investments we made back in 2017 2018 time frame One was a company called bitwise which was creating an ETF for crypto so it's a a Monthly rebalanced portfolio of I think the top 10 crypto currencies and you could buy it They finally got approved by the SEC and you can buy it like it like with a ticker symbol from your E trade account And Robin Hood or E trade.

Exactly. So that was that was pretty incredible to see the progress they've made And then the other big bet we made was just institutional custody back in 2017 We invested in BICO actually Bill Lee helped found that company Many years ago and then that became last year Galaxy announced a deal to acquire them for thing 1.2 billion largest crypto acquisition to date The thesis there was just that crypto would go more institutional And I think we're starting to see that now where endowments and so on are realizing they need to have some portion Maybe one or two percent of their portfolio in crypto.

And so, you know, it's unrealistic Look, we have to almost three trillion dollars of market cap in crypto It's unrealistic for folks to expect people to be able to be living in discord channels and doing all of this work I think what that means is that the SEC is going to be asked increasingly more often to To approve simpler on ramps for this stuff and now in the last week, by the way We had a pretty important two things happen both Jerome Powell and Gary Gensler basically said Crypto's here to stay and you know, we're not going to ban this stuff And so hopefully what it means is that you get some ETFs passed in the United States You know grayscale is one there could be more and I think that stuff makes it much easier for folks to Own this stuff.

Well a clear regulation would be a great thing for the industry for people to buy into it and removing some of the let's call them I Don't want to say bad actors, but people who are maybe questionable like tether, you know, I don't know if you saw the Bloomberg story yesterday But you know a Bloomberg reporter basically found out that tether he got the list of what tether owns with their stablecoin and It looks like they're giving a lot of loans to other crypto projects and own a lot of Chinese paper In that they are basically making the float on 69 billion dollars sweeping it Which then incentivizes them to take risky bets because they get paid on them and it's anything but a stablecoin If you think about it from that regard, it's I don't know the details on tether I won't speak to that but I'll say that any stablecoin if it's not 100% backed By dollars if that's the currency that's going in and out or yeah other hard currency That's not a stablecoin right you know a stablecoin is supposed to be a service.

It's not supposed to be a a Speculators currency. It's basically just supposed to be a mechanism by at the on ramps and off ramps of the crypto ecosystem You can convert your dollars into a temporary Like in stablecoin that will hold a ship you can try a poker chip that you can use to then buy Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever Yeah, USD see USD see Jeremy allaires Circle competitor from circle Just said that he would switch to a hundred percent to what you're saying cash cash equivalents It guys this is this has always been a money market fund It should be right treated like a money market fund and it should be regulated and managed like a money which was tethered There's original vision and then they flipped the script because I think they got greedy and now they on I think Regulated by the way by the way it speaks to the role of regulation Like you know a lot of people have trust and faith because they make some claim but there's no regulator actually checking on their claims The only people that want regulation are two ends of the spectrum so young and so disruptive where they want rails to operate legally and So big and so over the top that they want to basically entrench themselves for the rest of their lives.

That's it Everybody in the middle doesn't really want regulation. What's a what's a way to create a company or if you're big tech you both want regulation Well, but yeah, but there are some narrow cases like again You know if if if a stable coin is gonna say that we are just a money market fund We're a hundred percent dollar reserve. It is really nice to have a regulator Somebody we trust to go in there and put the stamp approval on it. FDIC trust it or that is That is a valid role. I think for a regulator in traditional financial markets.

You have these self regulating bodies I Think it's finish a self regulating body, right? And so, you know, so many self regulating bodies should be formed in the crypto community I don't know if they're doing this. I'm so naive in the space But certainly would make sense to have an SRO form that that does self policing effectively within the community rather than try and bring in a government regulator. Here's the thing if you police yourself you can Really define the execution and the ramifications of that policing if you have 30 call it Competitors and cooperators in the in the market space doing this together.

It can be a highly effective model for creating a system of trust and reliability and not having to You know, bring in, you know, call it outside incompetence to overseeing the rules and rights Yeah, another area we need standards is around the token cap tables for these projects, right? So how much how much of the token cap table goes to the founders? What are the rules around them selling? What are the investing periods and what are the disclosures around them selling? In public markets, we have 10 B5. So if you're an insider who runs these companies, you have to disclose when you're selling There's no similar rule for crypto.

I think there probably should be right like if you own the if you own the token And you run this project as publicly traded in the public and buy it You should really probably have to disclose your your sales and maybe You know these it's very strange because they're running foundations and I had a crypto person on from a music crypto project and He said they had like three or four hundred million in this project in Panama I was like who's on the board of that and he's like I can't say Why can't you say and he said security reasons? I was like well anybody who's on a public board has to be public and of course they have sick You know people who are on the board of GE or IBM or Amazon they have security issues like they deal with their security issues That doesn't mean they don't disclose who they are.

I think yeah I'm not comfortable saying who they are and it's like, okay. Well, they sold three or four hundred million I was like, how do they give that money out? I'm like, he's like, I'm not sure I'm not on it I'm like what like there's some organization in Panama. That's It was really weird And I think one thing that I'll say positively about about these crypto founders is that they Will never allow a single venture investor to clog up their cap table number one They do a great job of creating these large broad syndicates of participation when they seed their projects And then you know a lot of it goes into Treasury where then they issue coins as needed And I think that that strategy actually is very pro employee and pro ecosystem So, you know when we see these projects all these companies tend to raise, you know, three four five million bucks It all tends to be at like 30 million pre and it all tends to be Distributed so like, you know, you know It's us and recent Sequoia and it's like, you know, we put in 200 grand each or 400 grand each You know, that's why you're forced then go into the market if you believe in a project and then spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy Into it after the fact and I think that that's very Very powerful.

It's a really important dynamic that if it comes back to Traditional venture could be really disruptive. Why well, could you imagine a SaaS founder that basically all of a sudden says, alright You know what? I'm raising a six million dollar series a, you know craft can take 500k Sequoia You can have 500k, you know, blah, blah, blah folks and then you raise six million bucks that way and you never allow anybody to have more than Call it, you know a few percent of a company. So the fact that it's like it's like a mini IPO It's like a private IPO on Santa Road.

Yeah, and then your board construction looks entirely different and then as a result You know founder protections probably go way up employee protections probably go way up. It's and go and goes way down No, I Actually think what will happen is you're less likely in a round like that to be okay with some dork dingleberry joining your fucking board You're gonna actually point to some industry expert and say this person is joining my board She does XYZ job at such and such a startup and then the investors say wow Well, that's a pretty great advocate for the business go ahead and do that Another thing I learned about this whole token space was when I talked to Anatoli from Solana When they sold their 300 or 400 million tokens to fund The company because they consider them utility tokens not shares.

They paid taxes on it So the IRS is getting massive amounts of tax revenue. Well, think about it. They're selling the token It's supposed to be for utility with their forest a taxable event that actually was really smart That is showing I think some wisdom Because there's a lot of founders who want to have their cake and eat it too Which is to say they want to say that these are utility tokens And and they don't pay tax and then when they later get traded they want to say that they're not, you know They're not securities, but so when does the tax get paid? I think it's really smart to pay the tax upfront to establish So this is a corporate sale.

They're basically paying the corporate tax, right? Yes that is what is because this is this is the problem is if if you wait until they're traded publicly and then say no No, no, no, they're their utility tokens on security tokens the government's gonna ask you well Why didn't you pay corporate income tax when you sold them, right? So that is actually showing some perspicacity I think Could somebody look that word up for me? Forsightedness jcal. Okay, great awesome It's so great that you have the two producers on either side of you right now feeding you vocabulary words.

Well done So here's it here's um You know another question with this if the majority of people sacks Just put your legal hat on for a second if the majority of people who bought a token in a project We'll call it the you know act me crypto project. They buy act me coins if they're buying them and they have absolutely no interest in Using them for the utility and they say I bought these as a speculative device and the founder says they're utility tokens But let's say 70% of the people who bought them said I didn't buy them for that reason They just came out right and said I bought this to speculate on the price.

What should the government do? Should they deem them a security or should they deem them a utility token? I think that's a complicated question But I think that there should be an opportunity for these cryptocurrencies to establish themselves as utility tokens because they are They do serve a purpose. They are designed to be part of a system, right? They're not just Objects of speculation and by the way, even if they were we don't we don't treat baseball cards as you know as as sort of Security so it wouldn't necessarily make them a security just because they're speculated on they actually do serve a function and a designed Computer system.

So I think what's important here is that there's a safe harbor Where these crypto companies know what the rules are and if they if they can basically Meet the criteria such as by paying corporate income tax when they sell the tokens and other things like that That they won't later be deemed to be engaged in an lawful sale of securities I think the important thing is just that entrepreneurs founders know what the rules are so they can abide by them and not be Right now. Well, so they don't get surprised later. They don't get whammyed But with basically, you know, because they are building something legitimate here, you know, right? But it would seem to the sniff test if the people buying the tokens have no idea have never written a line of code have no use for them I don't see why that's relevant.

I don't see why that's relevant Well, because they're profiting off of them as if they're shares and unlike baseball cards, which you can't sell a thousand baseball cards for an increasingly You know in a very instantaneous way, you would have to put them in an auction You could sell. It would be a lot of friction. You could sell fiscal coins Yeah, uh, Freberg, what do you think if the majority of people buying a token are doing it to speculate? Can the founder say it's a utility token and then those people who are trading it like either baseball cards Minted coins, whatever analogy shares you want to use are in it for the Increase in the value should it be a security and should they have to play by the rules we play at in the traditional venture startup game? I mean the question is what's the utility? So, I mean if you can demonstrate some utility Then maybe that's the the and this will probably be litigated at some point, right? I'm sure there'll be enough capital Sloshing around here that someone will say, you know what we believe strong.

I mean, we're seeing this happen with ripple already But someone will litigate this and we'll get some clear definition on you know, what's that you're saying? On you know, what statutes are going to be referenced and what those statutes might say with respect to the how this ties to the definition of utility and Then that'll become hopefully a standard that that people can kind of look to to guide them in the future But it's definitely the wild west right now and the reason I bring it up is because gentsler was sort of Floating this argument.

Chamath, what do you think? I think that um, you can't wipe three trillion dollars of value out of the world And so so pragmatically hard to do got it. So it's here to stay And it's too institutionalized now. So, you know, there's just way too many organized pools of capital that are now speculating Inside of this entire ecosystem You know, I saw a tweet today. There was a there's a firm. I think like called jump trading or something It's like a high speed frequency trading Organization and they tweeted out some pictures where you know, they're they're uh They hired a bunch of folks to start a jump and they did a coding boot cap on Solana That was their onboarding as an example.

So when you have people in high finance, you know, really vested in this thing And you have three trillion dollars of value that'll go to six trillion and then go to 10 trillion This can't go away. So That's why I think powell and gentsler had to say Some version of that on the record, which is, you know, we're not going to ban this stuff because they know it's not possible So I think david's right. You have to create some rules Make folks and let folks pay their taxes You know, I remember for example, like I did this bitcoin transaction in 2014 or something.

I bought some land I used bit pay I transferred some bitcoin bought the land blah blah blah. Yeah, it was like a you know, whatever But whatever I mean, I I left I mean, I owned a lot at the time. So it wasn't that big of a deal But my point is finding a way for me to pay my taxes was a huge deal. I remember and You know, we filed the tax return and we tried to make sure that we paid our taxes These are very complicated Even if you want to be conformant to the government, it's impossible right now So they just need to create some rules where folks can say, here's what I own Here's what it's worth.

Tell me how much I owe you and we're all willing to pay or not maybe we're on a I'm I am Because I just think it's like make sure that we can we can trade around it hedge it Structure it do the things that we would normally do with any other risk assets right now That's very hard and when you own Lots of this stuff It sits in your balance sheet and you just take these Enormous swings and you're just like god, you can't do anything around this stuff And that's not a viable financial market.

That doesn't yeah to be specific about what Gensler said, I just looked it up here, you know, he compared utility tokens with you know, laundry mat tokens or tickets to the opera and he said entrepreneurs are Choosing to perceive their tokens as utility to sidestep regulation And that here's the quote. They are a highly speculative investment tokens For people who are trying to save or speculate for the future their future And that's why I think it's appropriate to bring them inside the investor protection Preliminary I agree with him. I also agree with you Chimoth that this is a can of worms that I don't know how you put the gene back No, but he's he's partially right.

I mean, he is partially right on some tokens, but he's not Completely accurate on some other tokens. I think it's on a case by case basis and it depends Listen, I think anybody who is buying these tokens right now knows that they're engaged and in financial speculation This idea that people in middle middle America are going to blow their retirement savings on crypto I don't I just don't know but if they know if they're doing speculation, then it should be a security No, no, no, David. I think you're totally wrong. I totally buy it. Look at the quarterly returns the filings of earnings from companies like Robinhood and how much and square and how much money they make from crypto and look at their audience That's totally not true But don't you think that audience skews really young and they're getting their like covid stimulus check and they're yellowing it into meme stocks or crypto? What does that have to do with well because you're making it sound like they're going to blow their retirement savings? Okay.

Well, if you're talking about a 25 year old who's got $5,000 of retirement savings, maybe But they still got you know, they still got 40 years of working on crypto Hold on a second. Wait. No, they don't This is going to be the least hardworking generation of our lifetime. Why? No, no, no, not not because you're not hardworking Why there's 70 trillion dollars That boomers have that they are about to pass down to these folks on average between two and three trillion A year for the next 30 years Also, they know how to do gig work like they're so smart this generation They don't have to do projects for five grand and float themselves You're going to take one entire turn of the world's GDP And give it to a hundred million people in America over the next 20 to 30 years.

That is what is actually going to happen So, yeah, look, I think of course they're going to keep you allowing this stuff. Yeah, look I think I think we're getting off on like a little bit of a tangent here. My good one My point is not that there shouldn't be investor protections But rather that I think we also need to balance another important objective Which is to create a hospitable environment for innovation And the fact of the matter is that you've got a lot of brilliant young entrepreneurs Computer scientists building this financial infrastructure of the future with crypto.

It's not just Speculation there is a lot of code being written. It has functionality. There's a purpose to it We don't we don't necessarily want to interfere with that to the point Every startup has to do their securities though, David All the other startups that are not in crypto are playing by the rules. So it's crypto people get a pass. It's unfair. I agree with J.K.L. People make this claim and I just think it's so specious Do you think that you would have made a single professional decision in your life based on tax rate? Have you ever made a single like I'm going to start this company.

I'm going to make this product You know, I'm going to change this job. I just think that most people I'm not talking about paying taxes I think it was smart for for example, Solana to pay corporate taxes on their token sale I think everyone should pay their taxes. That's not what we're talking about here And I'm not saying that Gensler shouldn't prescribe regulations I think that part of the purpose of those regulations should be to give Entrepreneurs predictability to be able to give them a safe harbor so they can build what they want to build Let me make one final point.

I'm just saying from my perspective I just think that if you have clear sensible taxation, that's 90% Of what this industry needs and I don't think it will it will change anybody's real motive to work inside this ecosystem just like just like entrepreneurship doesn't change when capital rates capital gains I've paid taxes At you know on all my crypto sales like it was any other investments since the beginning That's not the issue. The issue is when you're a company and you're raising money Should you be allowed to not follow securities law because you say it's a token Friedberg When you look at this an NFT company came out last this past week That was selling shadow shares in startups and anyone in the world could buy A shadow share in a private company like Stripe, etc in this fantasy football league They wound up shutting it down or changing it because they didn't want to trade on other people's intellectual property They were concerned about that but just looking at it The public in America 96% of them who are not accredited cannot Buy shares of Stripe in the south And it cannot buy shares of Stripe in the secondary market But you can buy NFTs in it and speculate on the NFTs which are accelerating from you know A thousand dollars to 500 thousand dollars in these different clubs Um, how is it fair that crypto companies get to not obey basic securities laws? Friedberg well, it's not a security.

There's no underlying asset Okay, it's a collectible and NFT is clearly a collectible jaco Uh, okay, and I don't have I don't have any legal I don't have any legal ownership of them and have a marketplace for people to sell them and they're appreciating I mean, I I do agree something different sounds like art to me Yeah, you could go draw a piece of picture of Stripe and put it on a piece of paper and go down to downtown Wherever in stand in front of the burrito shop and try and sell it It's qualitatively different than a security, but they're acting as securities in relation to the fundraising of these projects So I think that's the challenge.

Not everything is a security. Yeah, there's no secured interest. You don't have any secured interest It's literally just a uh Like an image of figure. I was just offered a jacquemete sculpture, but I turned it down How much 60 million Was steven cohen selling it I'm not commenting on the seller. I bet steven cohen was selling it. That was the record deal Uh, steven cohen bought that jacquemete sculpture a few years ago. It's like the highest uh price ever paid at auction for a piece of art in the u.s Can I can I just tell you my problem with with it? I I took the price and I divided it by the height in centimeters and it just tilted me Is price per square inch a metric in In 2016 steven cohen paid 141 million dollars for the jacquemete sculpture Lom odo odoit It was pretty uh incredible and I think you're right.

It's about 12 inches tall or something That's a little bit Looks like it was done by a 12 year old. Oh my god, stop jacal jacal You're gonna stop. Yeah, this is a billionaire equivalent of uh of crypto and nfts, right? Totally. Totally. I don't know what scan this guy's running But that looks like anyone could raise their hand And say I have an independent objective assessment of the value of anything in the world Um, and you can look at it from high to low and this is all Effectively it's objective looks like it was a beautiful sculpture that was in a giant fire and that somebody pulled out of the ashes It's a beautiful piece if you want to read a little bit of art history Yeah, you can understand a little bit about jacquemete's work, but it's um, it's a 70 inch piece not 12 inches.

Sorry and um Yeah, his work is all about kind of like how do you capture the essence of the form? Anyway, this is a super ridiculous tangent Looks like somebody made something out of mud and put it into a clay oven I have a very funny stevie cohen story. So this is like 10 years ago at art basal in miami And uh the day before the art fair opens it's called the furnacesh for rich people And so uh, you know, uh, it's like a day where you can go and see the the stuff The day in advance and you can you know kind of buy stuff or whatever And uh, it's very funny.

It's kind of like a You know like when walmart does like a black friday thing like everybody lines up And then they open the doors and we all run in and I was standing side by side We were right at the front of the line and I noticed that he had these uh, and this is my first time there He had new balance running shoes on And I thought what is he doing? But then when the doors went open they just took off and started running and I was walking wearing normal loafers And then I realized I should have been wearing running shoes I'd own normal loafers.

You were wearing Italian loafers. Uh, I missed that on everything I like the balloon dog guy. It's like the it's like the running of the bulls I'm just Running of the bulls. I'm just out on everything running of the billionaires I got to the things after and I was like, oh, sorry. I sold it to stevee coen I sold the stevee coen Jesus christ I had blisters on my feet. It was brutal. Do you guys know we haven't even started our agenda? No I'm fucking moderating this Three two, all right, so blow it here. It's occurred.

Yada yada Hey everybody. Welcome to the online part of great All right, let's start our show I'm sure everybody by now has seen uh, francis haugen uh on 60 minutes and testifying Uh, she seemed incredibly credible. Uh, well spoken and had very common Sense non extreme views about what should be happened What should happen with the research that facebook has been funding? Um, that shows like other media forms uh instagram and facebook have a really terrible effect on young people specifically young girls and uh body dysmorphia Which seems to be the one thing that is landing pretty well Her suggestions were not to break up facebook hers was to have a regulatory body and to do soft interventions if you don't know soft interventions Her suggestions were worse than breaking up facebook.

Well soft interventions. Let's get to that Include things like hey in order to retweet the story on twitter. You probably should read it first She thinks she wants to reform or she's an advocate for reforming section 230 in relation I think to the algorithms Uh, and the idea here would be that the algorithms are making an actual editorial decision Which is something that I remember in the youtube early days They said we will not feature your videos that you're making but we will have the algorithm pick them because that keeps our safe harbor zuckerberg came back and uh wrote a spirited defense Basically saying why would we do this research if we didn't care the people at this company care a ton? sacks and the entire peter teal cobble of You know acolytes and friends are coming on strong as pro facebook.

I'll have him talk about that He thinks it's a facebook. Uh, it's laughable that people are Addicted to facebook yada yada. So who wants to go first you trim off or sacks? Well, look, let me let me say a couple things I think that um, I think zucks the title of zucks internal uh Company post could have been titled nah, ah Uh, which basically this was his way of saying this is ridiculous and I don't believe it the The thing that she asked for in Substance is a little different than what the doj Did with microsoft in 2000 but in form is actually quite similar Which basically is like gumming up how the internal product development would work inside the company and you know the most damaging thing You already saw which is that they had a bunch of planned product releases And then they put them on ice and I think this is really Where unfortunately The most damage gets done because Engineers won't really tolerate that for some amount of time right they'll put up with it initially But you know you've had uh, I don't know.

I think like a 20 reduction in stock price So you had you know, you lost 200 billion dollars of market cap There's probably going to be more turbulence in the company You can sustain and get through all of it as long as the engineers hold the line But if you basically slow down and put a pin in their ability To generate code and to put out features On the margins enough people I think will get frustrated and leave and I think the way that she you know what she is asking for Was tantamount to that and I think that's the really destructive part of Of what could go on here.

So they need to get this Pin down quickly get in front of regulators get some laws passed whether it's section 230 or whatever That's the path to salvation for facebook Sacks, what do you what do you think I see you're basically saying this is like ridiculous and silly on twitter Mike Salana saying that Obviously peter teal is on the board of facebook and you're gonna have to you're gonna have to give me time to unpack this jay cal I'm not getting hysterical because there is there's a lot to go over here I want I'm literally throwing to you in a non historical way.

You think that this is there's nothing to this first Well, let's let's understand what this really was. Okay You have this so called whistleblower who Is working with the staff at the senator's committee giving documents to the wall street journal and then appears on 60 minutes in this great unveiling 36 hours later. She's testifying on capitol hill That does not happen. The senate committees do not operate that fast. This was coordinated She's got a democrat a well known democratic operative named bill burton working for her. She's got a team of lawyers She's got a pr team this whole thing by who this is a coordinated hit Okay by anti facebook forces starting with the senate judiciary committee Who want to regulate who she's working with the staff jay cal.

Jason stop. You're interrupting Jason stop asking you who you said He's working with so I don't know who it is. Just let him make this argument and then just stop let I want to hear what he has to say Okay, what is the purpose of this testimony? First of all, we can go over the details of what she said I don't think there's anything new here. This was all the same arguments We've been hearing from these same sort of forces who want to regulate facebook whether it's the Um, whether it's the senators on the committee who've hauled up zuckerberg no fewer than four times to lecture him about the need for more censorship Uh, or it's these forces the media who basically want facebook.

It's all about, you know, having more censorship Um, but in any event there was nothing really new there. Um, what this really was was corroboration and Of of of the same talking points. We've been hearing for years And we're and what it's all leading up to is there's a very important part of her testimony Which is this is really the crux of it is that they that she proposed and what blumenthal once sees the chairman of the senator district committee Is a dedicated oversight body. This is in this clip Okay, with a power to oversee social media platforms.

So what we have here is the government is now going to have a new agency They're saying like the fdc Then she said a regulatory home where somebody like me could do a tour of duty after working at a place like this and and Hogan said right now the only people in the world are trained to analyze these experiments to understand what's happening inside of facebook Are people who grew up inside of facebook or pinterest another social media company basically people with her experience I mean, I have to admire the chutzpah. I mean, she's basically proposing That she be made zuckerberg's boss Okay, that a new oversight board be created by the government Which she would be appointed to which she presumably would run and this board is not gonna Uh prescribe regulations and rules for social networks in terms of how their news feed is gonna run That is what was proposed on capitol hill.

That is what this operation is all about So it's about her getting a job and being uh, lording over facebook is your claim No, I think I think I think the purpose of all this is to create new regulatory oversight of social networks I simply would note that she has proposed herself as somebody who would be on this board Which is pretty amazing, but what this is really about is that new oversight power And is that a republican or a dem are you insinuating? It's democrats who want to regulate this or all politicians want to regulate this because they're scared of facebook having too much power Which I think we all agree facebook has too much power In in the public you've had the leaders you've had the leaders on the senate judiciary committee now for months Calling up zuckerberg and orc and other social media leaders and basically Lecturing them on the need to censor more to take down more material that is their objective This is not a conspiracy theory on my part.

This is expressly what they've said. Okay now until now Is it left or right or both? Let me come to that. I think the republicans are a little bit confused on this issue But let me get to that so what you've heard until now is uh, it is that is Is a tax on the supply side of the platform So what they've advocated is de platforming people with heterodox heterodox views dissenting voices and they have been Deplatformed in large numbers. Obviously it started even before trump But certainly the sitting president united states was de platform youtube just took down a million covet videos because they disagree with official position on covet So until now the censorship has been on the supply side of the platform What they're advocating for now is censorship on the demand side of the platform, which is we're going to rewrite these newsfeed rules Okay, we're going to rewrite them because we can't give people what they want The they're making these algorithms sound like they're these incredibly evil sinister things all the algorithms do At the end of the day is give the user more of what they're looking for Okay, and that that is that is not good enough for these politicians They want to rewrite those not actually what they said they want to rewrite these rules to determine what people see no no what they said about the algorithms was that the algorithm had a multiplier on it and that This multiplier of people resharing it reengaging the content would lead people and this was statistically proven in facebook's own research That things that were either misinformation Or that were supercharged Uh, you know Polarizing issues they would rise quicker which then gave people not what they wanted in their feed They gave people what would increase the length of a stay on facebook or on youtube or on twitter for that matter And they think the antidote for this is to maybe not allow things in the algorithm to go viral because what you're doing is saying Things that are either misinformation or polarizing Um, or we'll make things go to the top of the list and maybe we don't want that as a society Let me intervene with a with a point of view on this because I think you're head you're headed down a path that um To me, I don't think actually speaks to what's really going on.

It sounds like there's some sinister arch It's like a you know architecture here that's driving this outcome If you want to say that yeah, well, I mean it's implied because it's like oh well, they're they're multiplying sinister stuff What no, I'm saying they're just care about length of stay on the site My belief is they just want to take care about revenue. Yes, that's my exactly my point Shama They care about what consumers want to consume and consumers demand what they want to consume So think about media in the old days, right? We used to have books that an author would put out every year and so the author would get feedback on the book And so it would be one year on that feedback cycle Then magazines would come out magazines would come out every month And so every month the magazine would get feedback on what sales were and they would make decisions editorial decisions And they would iterate tv shows came out every week newspapers came out every day Cable tv came out every hour and they could adjust their content Accordingly in the internet age the media is getting a much more kind of instantaneous feedback cycle and the The call it publisher or editor or curator of that media Ultimately ends up putting in front of the consumer more and more of what they want As a function of what they're choosing to watch and what we're calling kind of these algorithms quote unquote Are really just the same thing that editors and publishers and others have done in the past Which is looking at what the consumer votes by what they choose Making decisions to put more of the things that they want in front of them The consumer consumes more of that and here's what's messed up We're getting a very ugly look in the mirror and what humanity and what citizens and what individuals actually want to consume and choose to consume and get turned on by And that is what's making this also ugly and when we see that We don't like to accept the fact that maybe that is just what humans are attracted to and what humans want to consume at scale And we end up wanting to blame someone and I could argue and I think others could argue that these algorithms that are effectively just recursive optimization functions They're recursively trying to figure out what do people want to consume and then giving them more of what they want You keep saying what I'm solving for those very specific needs and use cases and and I don't think that those algorithms are Go ahead Tramot.

Why is it not want? I'm interested in that unpacking it. No the Everything free berg says is absolutely right, but it's not the word want. It's not what they want. It's what they will react to the most And sometimes what they react to the most consciously want I don't know but my point is that there's there's a I guess I don't I don't use Facebook But they went from thumbs up and thumbs down when I was there to like this nuance like there's likes. There's tears. There's Angry shares, but there's also analytics data on engagement right like on how long someone's watching a video or what I saw in there was that There was an amplification of things that were more extreme emotional reactions Right now and and the point is that I think everything you said is absolutely right The algorithms are amplifying.

I think all I would say is I would restate what you're saying is these algorithms tend to amplify The things that are the most extreme and illicit a reaction Yeah Those reactions aren't necessarily the things that you want Those are the things that you will react to the most and that's why the algorithm wants to serve That's why you see that the top 10 things that are reshared the most often tends to be very extreme right fundamental emotional responses Are typically associated with things that I think we call hedonism and the things that you can ignore your emotional responses And take another course of action.

We typically call altruism or what have you This is a Kind of a common reason why people would want to watch a comedy or watch a horror film because there's some emotional response It's not a universal response and people aren't rushing to the theater to watch documentaries They're not rushing to the movie theater to be like oh, I want to be informed and educated on something that's factual and interesting They want to go and have emotional experiences and that's how humans are biologically wired And the same is happening in these short forms of media these little tweets or these post on facebook David you do understand that they won't show Murders and porn on facebook so they're making an editorial decision to say hey, we're not going to include They will every night on the local news if it bleeds it leads that how long has that been the motto in media? So I'm listening.

I'm listening to hoggin on 60 minutes I'm hearing her describe a corporate profit making machine that tries to get more reach more ratings by fueling polarization Division and I'm thinking is she talking about cable news? That's what she's talking about. Isn't she is she talking about the new york times? Is she talking about the traditional media because every single thing she said about how social media fuels polarization and division applies to the media and yet those same voice in the traditional media are the first ones Howling about facebook and calling for its regulation It is completely hypocritical because The real purpose here is not to reduce divisiveness or polarization of society the regulations on facebook will not do that It is to seize control and influence over the machinery Of social networking why because the news feed now controls the flow of information in our society Don't you think the damage has been done though meaning in the sense that if you? cripple Facebook's product velocity And you shrink the surface area Of the areas in which they can operate Isn't that more damaging than any regulation? No people will just stop using it and then they will find another place to get that I've already stopped using facebook.

I've already stopped using facebook. Okay. I don't find it compelling at all And i'm not really on the instagram either I I do find twitter rather compelling and i'm probably more addicted than other things. Yeah exactly off the rails But but but here's the thing I think I think all of us on this show right now None of us find facebook particularly addictive in our own behavior. Okay I think we understand in our own behavior that facebook is sort of like a mildly diverting amusement that occasionally yields Information sometimes it's useful. Okay. We understand that it's sort of like a news feed with a lot of noise Okay in our own usage, but somehow we've bought into this larger narrative that in everybody else's Usage that somehow this is a brainwashing machine That is pumping people full of disinformation and warping their thinking in other words There's a sharp dichotomy between how we perceive our own usage and other people's usage and what I would submit Is our own usage is what we know and what we know to be true And what we believe about other people's usage is simply a narrative That's been fed to us over and over again by the traditional media who hate facebook because it's disimmediating them That is what's really going on here.

You may you may be right. I'm saying something different Which is getting apart from all of that stuff what's happening practically on the ground right now is That is a company who has to now slow way down And what i'm saying is that's not dissimilar to what microsoft had to do which was there was this 10 year period at microsoft Where they really couldn't innovate and that's really How the government solved the microsoft problem? Yeah, they they made them less aggressive right they gummed up the internal machinery So that microsoft couldn't really be there for the next few major so for example That we just spent we just spent 40 minutes talking about crypto What do you think the chances are that you know facebook now can land a really compelling crypto project right? I totally shut down with libra right? I mean they went after it and the regulators stepped in and it's too old for them to launch that after What happened it's it's zero, you know with their behavior in other arenas I think that like microsoft Back in the the late 90s.

I think there are real and legitimate concerns about the power of these big tech companies about how How big and powerful they've become about their ability to crush competitors? I think those are all legitimate and in a weird way if this government scrutiny slows those companies down That's not an altogether bad thing but I am concerned about That I'd say separately just because these companies do deserve to be scrutinized more. I do think that we have to see That the people who are engaged in this really coordinated hit campaign against facebook They have other and have another agenda and that is to control the flow of information online It is to control online discourse It's already been happening over the past year with censorship on the supply side of the news feed and now they're trying to control the demand Side I think we have to be extremely wary about this well David isn't you you've been on the other side of this because on previous Podcast you've talked about facebook being too influential having too many users And now you're saying well these tiny little news networks that get a couple of low millions He has a he has an issue jason with the way in which they're going after facebook Okay, I get that he thinks it's a coordinated hit fine, but you also have had an issue with facebook having too much power To take somebody off the platform or to promote certain ideas.

Yeah, so which is it? It seems like you're a little bit Both can be true. No, it's perfectly it's it's it's no it's perfectly consistent I've expressed concerns about the way in which facebook is is de platforming people. It's Samara summarily silencing them and ghosting them It's engaged in censorship. I've expressed concern about that But we should understand that the people in the senate judiciary committee who hauled up who had this hearing Who featured and spotlighted hoggan and turned her into this great hero? Their agenda is even more censorship They they are complaining about the fact that facebook is not censoring enough and that is what their real agenda is I do think it should have been disclosed that hoggan does stand to gain financially from Whatever happens, you know, I don't know that that's been confirmed that there is a whistleblower reward here So we'll have to wait and see about that.

I haven't heard there's no reward until there's a fine But you're not this right that she qualifies if she's a whistleblower She qualifies for what a 30 percent portion of or some very large percentage of any kind be here though What would the fine be? How would that be framed chamoff? This whole thing is just getting started. They're gonna be They're gonna be getting started and there will be settlements from those government actions And the and facebook as you all know will pay any kind of fine to put this behind You're the one that said jason they spent five billion just so that they wouldn't subpoena Zuck and Cheryl right that's what you said last week.

We talked about that last week. Yeah, so I mean I think there's a fine coming. Let's let's be honest. I do not think lean a con Uh or gary gensler or any of these other folks Are going to be in the business of making a quick decision Nor the doj nor any of these other folks They're gonna want to really take their time to figure this out But what i'm saying is it's not the ultimate result of it because I again I go back to like if you look at what happened in 2000 in microsoft the substance of what microsoft had to agree to was was Ultimately not as bad as the way in which it was implemented Which is that you know, my understanding was like microsoft had to submit Feature reviews to lawyers at the doj who would then approve You know updates and upgrades to their code base for things like windows That's what caused them to miss an entire wave of compute And so this is the this is the point which is I think practically speaking The beginning of what microsoft went through facebook is going to have to navigate and so the faster they can try To say all right folks, you're right.

You caught us Let us tell us what to do Maybe actually the the better path because it allows them to get past it because the longer this This this period of like gray stretches out. I think is is actually the worst outcome Well, let's go through what we each think would be a possible solution here to Allowing free speech to occur on facebook, but maybe not having the things that you know fake news You know misinformation, you know, maybe lowering down the rhetoric And the charged nature of the algorithm freeberg. Do you have any common sense solution here that might? address both sides of the issue freedom of speech and maybe Things being amplified to a hundred million people that are fake and and just simply not We've talked a lot about this notion of like decentralized social networks, I mean we haven't talked a lot.

We've talked a little bit about it, but If you end up putting a regulatory hammer down on facebook and twitter and telling them What consumers and remember these guys aren't media creators their platforms effectively for search discovery and access So you as an individual can discover third party content on their platform If they start putting the regulatory hammer down on these quote unquote platforms telling them what they can and cannot make available to their users There will be another platform that will emerge and that platform may end up being in this kind of Decentralized model and in that decentralized model, you're not going to have the same degree of regulatory oversight And that system will end up solving the same use case eventually Consumers will get what they want which is you know, what chamoff calls kind of this emotional response Is eliciting this emotional reaction? They will consume it until they you know Achieve one of their kind of seven deadly sins objective which is what's driving the emotion underscoring their decisions on what to watch what to consume and And there will be an alternative.

So, you know, go ahead and play whack a mole You'll play whack a mole for a few years maybe a few decades But at the end of the day digital technology in a connected world will drive consumers to exactly where they will naturally find themselves Which is consuming ever more of the things that create this emotional response in them The consequences are unfortunate. Um, you know, I don't know what the right solution is, you know, we've we've to some degree put a regulatory hammer down on things like smoking and in some places things like sugar things that have kind of a you know, uh An obvious effect on our physical health These other things that we're seeing now are having an effect on our mental health And I think that there may be kind of an emerging regulatory regime around mental health standards and how much of things can be consumed And I think what we're seeing is the leading indicator of this is what's gone on in china Because china is the nation that I would say is probably at the forefront of research and understanding of what the consequences are Of consuming more of more of media and content that causes an emotional response to you and what happens down the road isolation loneliness Suicide rates go up unhappiness, etc.

It certainly is the consequence, but it's not a function of any individual companies Um, misconvance of content to consumers It's just a function of where these systems end up going because of the way humans are biologically wired Um, and so I guess my my first concern is maybe we end up in a decentralized system That ends up replacing all of these tools and this just doesn't end or you end up having or yeah I mean it could be worse or you end up having these kind of regulatory regimes emerge. No, it'll be better a decentralized solution is actually No, better in one.

No, it's better in one key way Which is that it's fundamentally harder to create the exact same network effect and density That you can have with one monolithic closed system so You're much more likely to actually have a very fragmented ecosystem of hundreds of different solutions depending on What of the sins you want to feed or you know, what of the feelings you want to feel at any one time? I think it's a big assumption that it would be a fragmented network if you did replicate Facebook on a decentralized platform and then some piece of misinformation came out and a trended all the way to number one Like say the january 6th insurrection and no, no, there's not gonna be guns to that.

There's not one network There's not one understand that but if one now, hold on. Hold on. Let me finish my point If they if one network became so large and there was nobody who could turn off something What if people said hey, there's a riot going on at the capital and more people showed up with more guns, right? You have nobody to sit there and say hey, don't go to the capital turn those trending posts off go ahead sacks Okay, so let's let's talk about this problem of misinformation. Okay. I think there's an old mark twain quote saying that the Ally can travel around the world faster than the truth can put on its shoes.

Okay There is a problem of falsehood spreading online. I agree with you there The question is what you do about it and the problem we have right now is that Is that truth is in that by either beholder there is no Truth api and so at the end of the day, it's the people in power who get to decide what is true and what is false If you give them the power to censor misinformation Example we just saw we talked about in this program the rolling stone iver mechton hoax provably false story And yet rachel madel still had it up on her post.

She was not sanctioned by msmbc twitter never told her to take it down And she was not fact checked However, the hunter biden laptop scandal or story which came out in the new york post a couple weeks for the election Turned out to be a provably true story and yet it was taken down by facebook and twitter At the end of the day this term of misinformation is just another vector For partisan attack and it will be used by whoever we give the power to to decide what misinformation is So what is the answer then to this point of falsehood spreading online? Well, at the end of the day the answer to bad speech is more speech you try to create a free marketplace of ideas to let To let the good speech Uh drive out the bad feature prove that it's wrong.

That's the best you can do that's the best you can do in a free society Yes, but we this is the first time a free society has had social networks That can reach a billion people instantly in you know an hour So I think there's one differentiator there that we must think of if somebody defames you on a social network They are absolutely liable. I mean you can sue them. Okay, but I think and you should and I think we've talked about cancel culture People are destroyed before they even get their day in court I think I think that's being destroyed for something different I think if somebody it's because it trends if it didn't if it couldn't trend to so many people it wouldn't leave Lead to the cancellation and destruction of somebody's life.

You've talked about that many times yourself If if somebody libels you I think they should be you should be able to sue them And I think we could actually we could have a libel regime more like the uk Where it's easier to prove these cases in court and people are much more careful about defaming other people I would be very much in favor of that. Okay, because defamation is not free speech But the question really is about really we're talking about non defamatory statements that somebody in a position of power As a sighted is not true.

Many of these statements are subjective. Dave Portnoy got labeled for his subjective opinion about aoc's dress Why did that happen and why is that kind of labeling only used to protect one side of the political spectrum? So, I mean that that that's what's really going on here. Let's end with this. Uh, has anybody watched shappells the closer? I did incredible. I I watched it pretty incredible. I mean fearless Fearless is a word. I was really um, I think that he Slightly missed it Because I think he could have really actually called out cancel culture and woke us in more I think he kind of left it a little bit to me where I was like a little I don't know.

I just I just didn't think they were as good as his other ones and I felt like he didn't really Make the point he wanted to make it was a little convoluted somebody who can actually Stand up and and actually you know be more satirical And tell the story of why all this cancel culture and Defamatory statements and judging people doesn't make sense. But then did he seem he didn't he didn't get the job done I felt well, let me ask you this about the performance. Did he seem qualitatively different than you in that? The other times he seemed very light on his feet You know having a good time being a comedian and this time it felt like he was personally hurt Or he was it wasn't comedy.

It was less. It felt less comedic. I agree. It felt like he had an agenda He was hurt He wanted to get some stuff off his chest and there were some jokes in between Which is very different like the percentage of jokes in this is like 20 and the like heavy on max max And then the other ones were 80 jokes 20 social commentary. This felt like He um, he was actually really hurt and like I don't want to say bitter but just fed up maybe Frustrated he had a chip Which made it interesting to me, you know in the in the early 2000s chappelle for me Was really important because he was an advocate for minorities and I felt seen and protected by chappelle and uh And I thought that was really important And then his his comedy was just so sharp Oh, yeah And I said I just think that it was a little bit of an opportunity lost Yeah, I I think if he had really actually taken the you know, it to its conclusion, he would have actually There was just too many uncomfortable moments in that thing.

It was super uncomfortable at times and You know, I really would like to see it again Because you know, if you just think about his career, you know him talking about police brutality him talking about race in a very fearless You know entertaining but also informative way and and just being a truth teller. Yeah, this was So uncomfortable at times. I agree with that I need to watch it again and I need to let it sit because I was too It's on netflix. It's the last in his contract But yeah, I mean this could be I almost felt like he was trying to break netflix because he does seem to have a He does seem to have a streak in him where he's like Okay, I'm gonna I'm walking away from comedy central and he does seem to burn the boats It felt like he was burning the boats with netflix to me.

I don't know if you got that vibe where he was like This is the last one. I'm being canceled after this. Fuck yall. I'm out Um, and he has that I mean he torched it sacks. I mean you're gonna watch this thing. Oh now I'm definitely watching it. I I haven't not seen it yet, but I'm definitely watching I'll watch it tonight I give it a 50 chance that netflix takes it down Well, let's watch it quickly. There were there was everybody screaming for for him to be deplatformed Everybody was screaming. Well, then I like it even more You know one of the ironic things about these warning labels I've noticed they've sort of become a badge of honor where you know, if if the if the hall monitors a twitter are trying to label your tweet as as You know being in cindyry.

Maybe it's just interesting, right? I mean they're By to buy signal. It's a yeah, exactly. So, you know, um I was listening to uh, Antonio Garcia Martinez interview, uh, camille on um on call in and they they labeled that I mean just the post about they were gonna have a conversation You're saying the link to it was even flagged as like, oh my lord I think there needs to be a Netflix for a comedy where it's only subscription and It's owned by the comedians like if Dave Chappelle were to create his own Netflix I think it gets 10 million paid subscribers overnight first two years overnight now overnight overnight overnight Okay, so wait a second How do we wet our beaks on this if we go to chappelle and we say hey listen here's 25 million dollars We'll set up the tech team.

I'll I'll ask I'll ask k heart. I'll ask them this weekend I think that yeah, you get k heart you get chappelle you get sign filed you get um Now do you get louis louis ck in there or ck? What's his name? I never found that guy funny That guy never did it for me. Well, I mean anyway, you know, you know, it's funny. You know, it's funny Have you have you had this Asian guy Ronnie Chang? He's on uh There's a great nephelix special on him. He's fucking funny and then joe coy joe coy is very funny Yeah, I think Ronnie Chang Tape his own special Hasan minhach that guy's very funny.

He's great. He's he's legit, but I mean I this would be a great way for them to Just control their destiny and not have to worry about cancel culture because I think a lot of the folks who are on Well, they are probably the foot the last line of people that actually Will be the defenders of free speech. Yeah, it's pretty scary as much as I think Facebook should be more thoughtful about their algorithm, uh, you know back to you know circling And censorship back to the facebook issues I just think facebook should say hey listen We've throttled the algorithm so that any one piece of content Can only reach this many people over this period of time and yeah, sure that's going to lower our time on site or whatever But we want things to have a little bit of time to spread and get fact checked Does anybody think that that's a good idea to say? Just you know if you're trying to cancel somebody instead of it going to number one on trending topics before the person has a trial The algorithm would just take a little bit of time to propagate content.

Here's what I can tell you conclusively if facebook Wanted to solve these issues in the ways that the government Expects in their head for these problems to be solved Facebook market cap would be 250 billion dollars and they'd have a million people working there at the company So this is not an issue of whether it's possible The question is is it right and does it actually get at the solution or does it just as Friedberg said Create whackable someplace else and so you know, I don't know what obliterating Three quarters of a trillion dollars of market cap will do but I suspect that the government is going to want to find out So actually you think that throttling the the velocity of the algorithm So that news doesn't spread as fast and violently or which could be misinformation could be Be valid information.

Do you think that's a possible solution? Look, I think that at the end of the day with we're just closing the algorithm maybe With both facebook and twitter you only see stuff from people who you're following or your friends with it's actually not true What do you mean? If things they will insert stuff into your twitter algorithm now that's adjacent to you and facebook Will do that as well. Well, maybe maybe if people respond to someone who you're following But I've never seen anything my twitter feed other than an ad that's not from somebody I follow so you never went to trending topics No, I mean not my fee the explorer fee.

Oh, okay No, but you the explorer feeds right there and they are surfacing things in your feed now that are not people you follow But anyway, what they're really doing Okay, is there's a universe of people who you're following or your friends with and You could just see all that content in a reverse chronological feed But that would be too much. It'd be overwhelming originally worked. Yeah, exactly and I get it and that was fine I didn't I liked it. Okay, but as you're following thousands of people now There's too much content and so they will simply surface the tweets that you're most likely to want to interact with I don't believe by the way that those tweets are necessarily the ones that make you angry I think I think for some people it is clearly but it's not certainly not the case in my case what I would say is It's more refined than that.

It's the tweets that you think are interesting It's the tweets that perhaps express a sense of outrage that agrees with your sense of outrage. It's a little different than anger But it's it's basically the subset of content that you through your reveal preferences Have have shown facebook or twitter that you know that you care about the most And that's basically what they're doing. They're giving the consumer more of what they want And I think that we've blown this thing so far out of proportion I mean, yeah, there's an analogy that it's addictive, but I think that it's been blown so far out of proportion We've exaggerated the fear beyond any reasonable recognition Hmm by the way, I think the I think the reason that that tweet was flagged.

I'm guessing is that in the tweet Uh camille says he's going to talk about critical race theory and that may be why Or it could be because it was linking to the all right. Well twitter just said this conversations like this can be intense That's all I think because he says the gloves are coming off. It looks like to people fighting or whatever. I just think it's sort of ridiculous You know like this is where like the warning little circle. Yes, it's a little condescending like patronizing this content patronizing I think it's the word patronizing.

Yeah, exactly. I mean, I got the thesaurus up here. I'm not done Thesaurus here It's a very pale and runny you look out for me You was my brother I'm smart not like they say Oh Boys I love you. Happy 50th episode and what's going on with you freedberg and sacks that you're you won't make the journey down to the poker game Is this like some sort of David?

We beat him up Skyfall When you crumble Actually, the new uh, I'm really excited to see the new daniel craig uh double s7. I can't believe that Can you still rent a minter movie theater for like 50 bucks? Yeah, uh 300 bucks.

So yeah, it's basically not it was 99 during the pandemic. It was awesome I did it now and I haven't done it the last two times I went with the girls because it was first run movies and the theaters were pretty empty But it's like 300 if you get like 10 of your friends to come it's like basically five of your friends to come It's worth it. I mean that's 60 bucks each and yeah, I mean it's Or we just go to sax's theater. He's got the sax's theater is better because you have a chef there Who will make you food but yeah, and for those of you asking about the all in summit sacks and I are leading the charge for a February or april We got a couple of locations.
