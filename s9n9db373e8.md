Duration: 1 hours, 37 minutes, 13 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

It's Chimoth in a room with his PR crew right now like rehearsing and practicing and this pod is ruined Oh Hey everybody, so I just wanted to make sure based on last week's pod it was absolutely clear I care about human rights Many of you know my origin story, but for those of you that don't I I was born in a country that's no stranger to civil war and religious and political persecution Growing up my family and I felt those effects. It affected our safety It's in part what led my family to file for refugee status and stay in Canada So this is a real part of my lived experience That said, you know, I realized that what I said last week lacked empathy particularly towards others Who are dealing with persecution in this case the Uighurs and based on what I read this week I think what's happening to them in Western China is a terrible situation I also want to talk about this idea about nobody caring Look if we take a step back and replace Uighur with other really important issues like the conflict in Yemen the potential war in the Ukraine Gun control school shootings health care equity We're faced with horrible events every day However, the unfortunate state of the world today is that we've also normalized this routine of being confronted with something tragic or horrible or unjust and Being allowed to react with thoughts and prayers and this was the real intent of what I was trying to get across So when I talk about my line, it's not about whether something matters or not It's about which issues of all the important issues we face every day Where I have the expertise and I believe I have the ability to have a real impact even if just by a little For me those areas happen to be climate change life sciences and deep tech But just because this is where I spend my time.

It's not to take away from any of the real work any of you are doing in other areas And then lastly, I just wanted to explain to people who may be new to the pod because of last week That this is a place where four of us four friends talk about a whole wide range of things We explore our curiosities. We try to learn from each other. We challenge each other But we've always done it in a really supportive space and I hope you keep that in mind as you listen and watch going forward And hopefully can you can bring some of that to your own conversations? That's how I have to say Well said Sacks, I mean, I know you have something to say but I'll say I got a lot of messages this past week after the show where Which which I felt a little bit hurt by and mischaracterized and maybe it was simply I said the wrong thing at the wrong time And so I want to just be very clear about a couple of points if I can take a minute.

That's all right with you guys Yeah, so I said I just wanted to I was gonna actually send this out on Twitter and I decided it was better Just to address it on the pod so to be clear I strongly believe in and support Absolute freedom of all people and this means de facto I strongly disagree with the suppression of free speech denial of religious freedom imprisonment harm capital punishment slavery and genocide I Thought this was obvious when we were having our conversation. I did not know I need to be not in favor of genocide I'm not in favor of genocide I'm not in favor of slavery or capital punishment or suppression of religious freedom.

I thought this was obvious the conversation I tried to have was the wrong conversation at the wrong time Which was to try to talk about the broader China v us narrative That is swelling and will continue to swell this decade I think that the primary function of civilized society or any advanced social system is to take care of and protect those that cannot take Care of or protect themselves and this is usually done by government But when government fails and government is in fact the oppressor I think it is the responsibility of other governments and other people to step in and have a voice and to take action And so that is that is kind of my moral framework.

I think it's important I don't deny any of the harm being done to the Uighur population in China I don't agree with it on a principal basis and I don't think that what the Chinese government is doing is right And the point that I was trying to make during our conversation was a very different one that I think got completely lost in the moment Which was really just about what's going on with the China US narrative right now. I'm not pro China I'm also not anti China. I am particularly interested in understanding the broader China US dynamic And what it means for the world over the coming decade and decades I think it's really important for us when we evaluate these things and to understand them to not just take sides But to understand the context in the broadest way possible And that's why I am trying to get both sides and understand the mindset of the people that are involved in running these governments And the way that this of this world is going to evolve as this economic tension continues to mount And so that that's where I was trying to go And I was just trying to highlight where I think everything is headed over the next decade or two Independent of what are obvious human rights issues going on.

So let me just stop there and say thanks for letting me say that But that was important for me to just be really clear on because clearly I wasn't clear last week So yeah, well, I'll just add to what you said that I also thought it was implied that you care about these things and that you're not In favor of them. I didn't think that need to be spoken Yeah, so I think it's it's nice that you're clarifying it But I think any reasonable person would understand that if you care deeply as a vegan about factory farming that you also care about humans and you know genocide and torture or whatever issue so I I think it's like an Your statement is so obvious that I wonder if you even had to have made it, but I'm glad you did sacks Okay, so I guess first I should say that You know what's happening to the Uyghurs in China is indefensible You've got reports of upwards of a million, you know of these people being held in detention camps or supports of Mass sterilization and rape.

It's like ethnic cleansing over there So that's absolutely wrong and it's one of a growing list of issues that we have serious problems with China on it Which include theft over intellectual property cyber espionage the bullying of their neighbors They're cracked out on dissidents the list goes on and on I mean, I think we have to be clear eyed about the challenge and the threat that China represents And we've discussed that on this pod many times That being said, you know, I think we saw this week was really about cancel culture, right? You had in response to last week's pod you have this online mob form and They want to take what you must said and interpret in the worst possible light So they can turn the outrage meter up to 11 and everyone gets to basically go on Twitter and virtue signal and say what great people They are and because Chimoth is a bad person And I just want to speak to that issue.

I mean, there's a huge amount of hypocrisy Going on in that because how many of the people who are tweeting their outrage and their denunciation of Chimoth are Doing it from a device made by forced labor in China wearing their nikes Made by forced labor in China on their way to target to buy cheap goods made in China How many of those people have actually lifted a finger in the real world to help the Uighurs? How many of them have sacrificed an economic benefit? In any way and so when Chimoth said nobody cares, I thought it was a really startling statement by him but if you define caring as Doing something more than just virtue signaling and expressing your feelings as actually making a sacrifice or taking a risk in the real world I thought he was frankly telling us a very uncomfortable truth We haven't really most of us done anything and in that sense, I think the reason why his comments hit such a nerve I don't think you get the kind of pile on that we got unless He's saying something that's hitting a nerve and I think the nerve the thing that he exposed is that we're not really doing more than Virtue signaling on this issue and Then came all the you know all the hypocrites you've got the NBA Denouncing him issuing a statement when what have they done? I mean when Daryl Mori spoke up on behalf for the protesters in Hong Kong the NBA shut down and sanctioned him and You know LeBron James said he was uneducated actually I think to her more it was pretty educated fellows going on so you've got those hypocrites You got the White House issuing a statement disavowing To Moth but Hunter Biden went over to China to manage billions of dollars for them and profited by his business dealings over there So there are a bunch of hypocrites and the list goes on and on and so you know I think that if in order for the mob to summon the outrage that it summons it requires them to I would say first put the worst possible light on what Moth is saying and to ignore I'd say the fundamental truth of it and second to engage in this massive hypocrisy And that is the way that cancel culture operates and I don't think we should buy into it So I appreciate what what you must said I think he's clarifying his remarks he's showing that he does care and he does have empathy as we all should But I think there was a fundamental truth in what she must said last week and that is what people are so uncomfortable with Okay, well said I have feelings and Most of all I'm thankful we had the discussion The goal of this pod I think what makes it special and why you all who are listening come here every week It's because you know, we're gonna be honest with you and we're gonna tackle these hard discussions and I think Freedberg's comments and Sax's comments really Explain that and what our intent here is and is human rights is one of the hardest issues to discuss That's why you don't hear it being discussed and there are not easy answers and I think you know, I was challenged by my besties on the episode and Their questions and their challenges were absolutely critical.

Yeah. Yes How can we care about one group of people when the people in our backyard? We're not caring about are we going to invade countries? These are very nuanced difficult questions But we must have this discussion and if we try to cancel people with a 20 second clip That looks completely different if you look at the two minute clip or you take the time to have a 40 minute Listen of the whole segment you get a totally different picture and I think it's very important to raise awareness About human rights and it is an issue that I have been passionate about my whole life And I'm not trying to virtue signal or score any points here, but I know firsthand that raising awareness and having the discussions reduces the violations because Dictators desk spots and people doing this kind of stuff do not want the heat of What happened this past week and what happened this past week is that more awareness was raised about the Uighurs and the situation That they're going through I think then you know as somebody who's monitored the situation Then I've seen in the last couple of years perhaps this was a tipping point and that is something good that can come out of that Discussion now on a personal basis.

I have had some feelings of guilt Because I was very hard for me to watch what happened to Chumot this week and to watch people dunking on him And then let's face it. I brought the topic up and I dug in with my feelings And it got a little heated and and I'm suddenly being portrayed as you know a hero in this discussion that that's not the intent and There's there's no hero or villain in this there is a hard discussion in this and I am extremely proud of my friendship with each of you especially you Chumot I am Extremely proud of your candidness and tackling these issues and making people think about them and You know, I'm just so proud to be friends with each of you and I'm so proud of the work We hear we do here every week and I think it's important work And I feel like I get smarter every week and and I hope the audience does too and I hope we can keep having these discussions And we don't make fun of each other.

Yeah, now let's yeah make fun of each other I mean, I don't know if we're allowed to laugh. This is like so serious and heavy, but so what you're saying is thank you Chumot I But sax's point about I mean look we've talked about cancel culture a lot on this show You know, we've always been I think generally able to be third party observers So what's happened and it was really interesting to go through the cycle this week Where you know, there was just kind of an echoing narrative On one thing that was said with one direction.

There were a few pieces though Chumot Right, I mean it wasn't there a piece from the Atlantic and some other pieces that kind of highlighted that Things that you said were things that a lot of people won't say and that's what was really so shocking for so many people What's the Peter Teal comment on this whole on all of this stuff? He said if no one's saying it, it's probably true or if you're not allowed to say it. It's probably true Yeah, if you're not allowed to say it, but um, yeah, it was it was really you think based on the mob that formed and You know, it's already kind of blown over and that's the way this kind of cancel culture starts But for that sort of that wide hot really intense day or two, you would think that like Chumot that practice genocide himself You know it You know because everybody comes out and the way that they make themselves feel better is by virtue singling on this issue And again, I would just say that I think we should be thinking about what do we do? You know, how do we actually make a difference because I don't think just virtually on the issue is going to do it and You know at the same time that this mob was forming against Chumot We had a two hour Biden press conference in which Biden never mentioned the Uyghurs once the press corps never mentioned the Uyghurs once So does that mean the Uyghurs are below their line? You know, why wasn't it mentioned? You know, shouldn't we be ganging up on Biden? Well, why is it? You know, why is the press gang up on Chumot when they're not getting up on Biden for that? So there is a fair amount of hypocrisy here.

I actually think Jason I think you make an excellent point that by discussing these issues and raising these issues it creates a little bit of a check on the people perpetrating these atrocities because They don't like to be exposed that way and you know, maybe we should be boycotting the Beijing Olympics I mean, maybe that should be on the table. Maybe we should be boycotting the NBA. I mean, let's have that Conversation. Yeah, or maybe everybody who goes I wouldn't want to see the athletes miss the Olympics But maybe they can each just raise their hand and do a you Or some sort of a signal to show they support the situation or they're aware of it with the Uyghurs There could be some, you know modest protest or statement they could make without ruining, you know, their lives work I always hate when the Olympics get canceled for some political reason because I think those people work so hard for it But raising awareness, you know, is a noble goal in all of this and then also doing things is a noble goal and Yeah, I mean, I it was very weird to watch the The mob form and then dissipate And just who was you know taking the time to actually listen to the full episodes It was clear from that Atlantic article and some of the nuance takes that they listen to the full discussion because there are bullet points here like Like there was somebody asked me a very challenging question I think it might have been you freeberg like Are we going to start invading countries over human rights and then there's more suffering and death and pain from the wars and and when do you decide As that the democracies of the world to invade the dictatorships of the world to Promote human rights.

Like this is a very difficult issue That the world has had to deal with sadly before and there is no easy answer there, you know, right? I think this is this is a point that I also tried to make on the last episode like freeberg did which is Um, I think it's I think it's actually great to have these ideals And we should have moral clarity about what's happening. And I think it what's happening is It's wrong. It's outrageous. It's an atrocity um But but the question is what we do about it and um, and the the reality is even though it's important to speak out about human rights these types of Fulminations about human rights when they become this sort of you know, when people when we get into this like frenzy It's been the prelude in pretext for every misguided foreign intervention that we've had over the last 20 years And the example? The iraq war.

I mean saddam Hussein was suddenly hitler You know the the goals of nation building afghanistan for 20 years our invasion of Libya, we got rid of gadoffy and we replaced it with chaos For years we were talking about how evil the taliban and their social system was and then we just handed afghanistan back to them a few weeks ago Exactly. So, you know and so these types of Um, you know when when you kind of you whip people up Over human rights. I mean I agree with the sentiment and I agree with the moral clarity, but I also can't help But recognize that neocons and the military industrial complex and the washam blob Have used this type of rhetoric for decades to corral us and stamp eat us Into wars and foreign interventions that don't make any sense And we all recognize after the whole project has gone wrong like afghanistan We become suddenly more realistic about the whole thing and suddenly, you know, we're not talking about You know the the the the sort of the moral atrocities of the taliban anymore But the discipline is to they're still there.

They're still there the discipline though is to be able to check ourselves Before we get into these interventions and I don't think we do a good job of that We're whipping ourselves up into these mobs and we're in a frenzy And the the raising awareness is something that has been lacking the you know certain organizations And I think it's very important that we don't take organizations that have engaged with a country Let's say china or saudi arabia They may have engaged in good faith with the goal of you know Engagement is a positive for humanity in the world.

Okay, if we engage with china and we are co dependent on each other Um that will lead to a better arc for human rights and for humanity and less and worse because our Economies are entangled and we do business together. Okay. This is a a fine premise What the dictators and despots want you to do is to fight each other and not look at the human rights atrocities So it's easier for us to say oh the nba. Oh apple. Oh, you know pick pick the uh the the company or corporate interest or organization that has engaged um, but by raising awareness Um Consistently it gives other people the ability to talk about this some organizations weren't willing to even talk about this or say the name Weegers and if we keep talking about the weavers the chance is that that situation improves I think there's a chance it does improve But I do think just like notion that the four of us can get together on a podcast and not get canceled Because you know we we don't collect money from advertisers and we started having these conversations amongst friends and we just put it on the internet Um, first of all, it's a great kind of reflection of what you can do in the united states With the freedom of speech that we have and we can just put this on the internet anyone can watch it around the world Uh, I don't know how many people are watching it.

But yeah, most freedom of speech mostly freedom of speech But I do think that it's it's pretty valuable and I do think that that's You know an important point for us is you know as much as chumoth got completely destroyed this week Um, you know the I gotta I gotta say other than covet. I'm uh, I'm feeling pretty good. You feel better You're pretty bummed for a day or two I mean, I think the the covet thing was scary because four of my five kids got it Um, so I was just like, oh my god.

That's true. How's everyone doing by the way? I'll I'll be very honest with you so Uh between both houses, um, you know mine and my ex wife's Four of the five kids got it our nanny got it. Nat did not and the youngest baby did not Uh, there's a real difference between in my house how the boys Experienced covet and how the girls experienced covet quite honestly it like we you know, we've expressed Certain symptoms specifically a really bad sore throat at a cough That the girls in our house did not the girls had more intestinal issues the boys roughly did not So it all manifested kind of in odd ways Uh, but god my god.

I mean a lot of pain in the ass Well to be going through that and then also like monitoring twitter and inbound your phone must have been blowing up I wasn't doing any of that. Okay, jason start the pod. Let's go. All right. Well, okay everybody. Welcome to the olympic podcast with us Uh, the sultan of science who's got a new startup. He launched. We'll hear about that later in the show the rain man himself and dare I say The dictator I was like, it's all like we it's all like we didn't warn you We got a 63 episodes.

We called him the dictator. This was about to happen Let's start to show everybody you guys are like after 20 years of friendship It's like I don't know the list is like 9 000 items long. I was like, yeah, I've been gonna cancel them. We got a long list All right, uh, so first up. I think we should start with um A duo of stories that relate to each other microsoft announced it's buying activision blizzard for 68 billion dollars of cash microsoft's got a lot of cash um And I think we all understand like why this is a great idea for microsoft with xbox and Obviously activision owns call of duty, which has 120 million or so monthly active users They also own a bunch of nerd stuff from blizzard like diablo world warcraft my favorite starcraft And those have upwards of 40 million.

They also had blood king if you remember that they make candy crush and those kind of casual games They have a quarter billion users But even with all of these, uh, it's a highly fragmented market, but in related news Alina con the I believe 32 year old head of the f tc Uh, who has written a bunch of pieces. We talked about this on all in episode 36 sat down with kaira swisher and andrew ross sorkin for an interview and Uh, basically we're moving or she intends to move the goalposts on antitrust I want to play three clips and have you each react to them.

Here's the first one And this is her take on changing the antitrust from consumer harm to now shift to Does this deal and we'll take the activation deal here as uh, but one example But you could take the instagram and the youtube deals as well Uh, do these deals substantially reduce competition In the future. Let's watch the first clip in certain cases may be too much success And so the question is when is the regulator supposed to say? This could work and if it works it's got to work too well It's an interesting question and I think you know for enforcers the real question is Is this the deal that could lessen competition? And in hindsight all deals to some all deals to some degree are going to lessen competition substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly Um, and there's also indication that congress wanted enforcers not just to act when you know The third and fourth companies are merging or the first and second But actually in the incipiency when you said see trends towards concentration that those can also be important moments for enforcers to jump in So, uh, what do we think? Uh, freeberg about this sort of new rubric Not consumer harm because obviously if Microsoft buys activation and makes those part of game pass and you get call of duty for free with your game pass And the candy crush games and blizzard games.

That's good for consumers They get a whole bunch of more games It would be like disney buying star wars you get all the star wars stuff in disney plus for the same low price Yeah, look sacks is our legal eagle here I'm legally good, but but I'll just say before, uh, you know, he probably speaks better informed than me Um, if it's not about consumer harm and it's about decreasing competition in this broadly I would argue subjective sense Then um, what's scary is that there are going to be decisions made By interpreters of what is and isn't competitive And ultimately if they're not trying to keep in mind the best interests of the consumer Then it is in fact going to cause consumer harm at some point not necessarily all deals that they block But there will be deals that they may block that may have benefited consumers Meaning prices go down imagine having all of your products integrated in one streaming service Instead of having to pay for three streaming services So instead of paying 70 dollars across HBO max and disney plus and netflix you get everything in one But today the regulators would not let those businesses merge because that would be anti competitive under this context And so this is going to be a touchy debate and it's going to be difficult I think ultimately to rationalize this if there is going to be a point in the future where we can actually show that consumer harm would be caused by decreasing competition in marketplace And so I would be nervous about that subjectivity and the slippery slope it enables I think it's a great point.

Think about it. If you had to pay instead of for disney plus you paid for pixar plus Disney plus marvel plus and star wars plus would be chaos in your household to manage all those accounts It's a much better offering better consumer experience. Yeah much better consumer experience and cheaper and this is why by the way I said sorry. I'll say this is why I said in the past It's we use the term monopoly as if it's de facto evil and bad But not all monopolies or businesses that have very big moats is another way to kind of describe them Are necessarily bad for the customer We get cheaper products.

You get better products. You get more of an advantage They may ultimately be yielded to be anti competitive in a harmful way Let me let me just necessarily always but let me explain to you where she's coming from like there's a fundamental pillar of capitalism That says that excess returns Must get competed away. So if a capitalist system is to be efficient If a company has profit margins of 99 Competitors emerge pushing those profit margins down to something reasonable where you get to some sort of equilibrium And the whole principle of what she's saying is in in the absence of competition We don't really know what the equilibrium Return really looks like and she's not saying that but that is the implicitness of what she's saying And so in the if you allow all of this stuff to aggregate Maybe google shouldn't have 45 percent EBITDA margins maybe in a really competitive society They would only have 18 percent And that's actually better net net for the system.

The problem is that counterfactual to your point free brick is impossible to measure How do you know and how much value do you need to take away of the panoply of things that google does to figure that out? And that's I think we're the problem with it, but you know, let's be clear Uh in 2019 I wrote in my annual letter There's a section called the the tightening of the regulatory noose and meaning it was a framework for how to basically dismantle big tech And element number one of that was a changing regulatory landscape and it's really incredible to see it in front of our eyes We got a bill that just left judiciary, right that was Effectively voted across the aisle that's now going to go to the floor of the senate Which is going to rewrite some of these anti competitors like 75 25 and it was a 50 50 committee of democrats and republicans So clearly across the aisle clearly across the aisle Uh, and I mean the funny thing about that was spine stein and pedia the two democratic senators from california where most of these companies are In in the wall street journal article that I read railed against it But still voted for it to go to the floor.

So it's I think some version of that is going to pass She's going to go and scrutinize these companies. I still think this microsoft activation deal on balance gets done Because if you take the absolute values away from it, the reality is that it's an adjacent part of microsoft's core business And there's nothing fundamentally Monopolistic about what would happen if you let microsoft and activision come together Could it reduce competition in the future? I think would be her new lens and if xbox has call of duty and Sony playstation doesn't or the next console doesn't maybe it does you could make the argument sacks What are your takes on this very hard? To apply standard of reducing future competition because as Aaron ross sarkin said very clearly All of these reduced competition is now we got to get into what does the word substantially mean in this context? Yeah, so my take on on lina con is that she's got some worthwhile observations on the problems posed by these big tech monopolies But I don't think she's got the right remedies.

So on the observations I think she's correct broadly speaking that these big tech companies the fangs They have way too much power in the marketplace. They are now gatekeepers over the internet that control all these powerful platforms and broadly speaking it is time I think to Uh to basically have some limits on those powers make sure they don't abuse it I think she's also right that the traditional standard of consumer harm doesn't really capture That sort of concept of market power for these free ad base services, right because there is no pricing Um, and furthermore, I think she's got a point when she says that you know When you say no pricing you mean facebook and google the consumer doesn't pay So how can there be consumer harm, right? So clearly that there's that that standard of consumer harm doesn't really capture The market power dynamic and then I think the last observation she makes which I think is pretty Pretty valid is this idea that you know when facebook bought instagram at that time it didn't seem to Be a problem, but it definitely allowed them to extend their monopoly From the desktop into mobile and it probably should be scrutinized harder My problem is with her remedies.

I mean what she's basically saying Is first of all like you said any deal that could decrease competition in the future is a problem Well, the whole goal of business and making business moves like an acquisition Is to build your moat is to is to win to create a more competitive offering So there's no limiting factor. There's no bright line test there at least with consumer harm There's a bright line test which is about pricing, right? It's mathematically measurable So you could create a model around it here. There's absolutely nothing and so what it's going to do is completely politicize The process of getting an m and a deal approved and you can see this when she's talking about you have impact on labor I mean, this is a total Let's this is a total stop to the labor constituency in the democratic party because look Facebook and google no matter how powerful monopolies they may be they don't have a dominant position in the labor market This is not true.

They're competing for the same engineers that every tech company is competing for So she's bringing a purely political consideration in now And so again, there's no bright line rule. It's going to be heavily political Companies trying to get a merger approval never know whether they're good or not and even after they get approved They'll never know they're good and I have a big problem with her saying that any deal That they approve can be reopened and reevaluated a decade into the future and reversed I the actions they're taking against companies needs certainty. That's the that's the real issue It's the the rules of capitalism have been that the smarter slash more strategic You know entity If they can run their plays more efficiently has the right to win Um, this is almost trying to say actually not really and that is very problematic.

Yes You never know you're good. You never know you're good And then the problem that it'll create in the equity market specifically is how do you actually? Drive shareholder returns and then what do all these shareholders then do If these companies are rendered to basically stay where they are And you take a snapshot I mean you take a snapshot of the economy and you say this was what it will be from now on But it's it's access point is really interesting It's going to require mna to become kind of a political maneuvering process similar, you know create sort of these uh, you know Obfuscated gates where you don't really know what it's going to take to get through there And then you've got to go do what you do when you try and convince foreign governments to work with you or allow You to do a transaction in a foreign government in a foreign country Well, you got to go in and you got to go figure out the politicians who they want who they are What they want and then put together a political consortium that's going to approve the deal Given that there's now going to be subjective Uh, you know validation whereas before I think the criteria were much more objective Let me play this other clip This is the clip that the sacks was referencing.

Uh, leanacon also talks about how labor Uh, unions are trying to get in on the action slash griff. See you on the other side Some of this research has showed that labor markets are significantly concentrated Um, and it's led to you know additional thinking at the policy level of how this should be affecting what anti and trust enforcers are doing So the justice department, um, including in the last administration started looking at no poach agreements Uh, more closely instances in which employers may be colluding to suppress wages Um, both agencies have been looking at the ways in which mergers in particular may lessen competition for labor And have downstream effects on workers in ways that are harmful and that also needs to be on our radar So I think this is an ongoing conversation But increasingly the question is, you know, how we implement some of these priorities and not, you know, whether they're important But this is the first time you've included labor.

This is something laborers wanted for a long time The idea of looking at anti trust through the lens of unemployment essentially Yeah, there's an interesting history here. I mean, um, you know, there were cases in which, uh, you know unions were supportive or transactions because they thought they would lead to more downstream benefits, but I think, um, we started to see Uh through retrospective studies instances in which, you know, mergers actually ended up having a harmful effect And so I think that is what's significantly contributing to this. This is this is also part of what I said in 2019 The third element of that plan was you have to change the rules on stock based compensation So instead of her talking about it as labor, I think the the more accurate way to say it is like There's very valuable human capital in technology business.

A few people have You know, discontinuous impact on these businesses And it has been a stated strategy of all of big tech to use their balance sheets to buy small companies in their Incipiency to use her words not because it helps advantage their monopoly, but it prevents the leakage of human capital Into other ideas and it prevents those other ideas from literally flourishing That's really what's been happening for years in Silicon Valley and we all know that You know, all the aqua hiring we see is about hoarding talent And you'd rather pay these people millions of dollars a year if you're big tech To basically work on next to nothing then take the risk of them going across the street to a competitor and then having them do something Sorry, they're all coming and this was such a this is such a no way But the oh, sorry just to finish the old one of the ways that you can change it is you have to change the way that stock based compensation works How it's accounted for you know, how you can actually deal with it on a gap basis how? Capitalists then treat that in terms of their earnings if you don't do that none of the models change people look past it People look through it.

They don't think it's a real cost which it is And then you're allowed to continue to do it. That's really the underlying issue So much so Chumath that the human the hoarding of human capital was a recurring theme on the Silicon Valley HBO show Where people in hooli were getting paid millions of dollars and hanging out on the roof Uh, freeberg when you look at this human capital labor bring brought into it isn't the point of a lot of m&a to Um eliminate jobs and eliminate redundancy. So if you brought in youtube at google I'm not sure if you were there at that time period the distinct concept was hey, we already have an advanced ad network We already have accounting and we already have servers around the world and storage You don't need to hire those people.

We can get rid of them or whatever and we get rid of that redundancy I mean scale large scale consolidation. That's certainly true Most m&a and technology is the opposite where an acquisition takes place and the acquisition gets fueled by further investment after the acquisition is made when youtube was acquired There was a few dozen employees there and then very quickly google scale that team the engineering team the infrastructure team They even had their own independent ad sales team Um to thousands of employees and without that it would have been very difficult for youtube to achieve that scale both from a product success perspective an infrastructure perspective But also an employee based perspective with the amount of capital it would have taken to go and raise that from venture capitalists Maybe nowadays where there's billions of dollars floating around it would be different But back then it would have been very hard and so what's the same for uh, what's up in instagram at face? Yes, exactly.

What's up was 19 people when it was acquired and now it's thousands I'm certain and instagram's the same and so what we've seen traditionally or not traditionally but over the last 10 15 years With internet based acquisitions is not about consolidation and reduction in costs But about taking and enabling technology and accelerating it on an existing platform Now number one it makes that new technology a product far more successful far more far reaching and more consumers benefit from it Number two is it now makes that platform harder to compete with so as a platform It's going to be a lot harder to catch up with the cash flows being generated at google and at facebook Given how quickly they reinvest that capital and new technology to further their advancement to your point.

Yeah, but I would say What's what's been so significant over the past 15 years that people are lifting their head up? Is it has been both beneficial to consumers and Competitive so that was exactly what I was going to get to here your youtube example is the perfect one because if you look at youtube think about all the joy education Communication it has created on a global basis as a juggernaut free Yeah, and it's free that has helped humanity so much in this new lens But no one else can make a video ad site like this Exactly, so we're now looking at all the benefit that youtube has created for humanity Versus the fact that it's going to be impossible to deplet displace youtube now To your point sacks.

How do you get past the bright line? Do you have a suggestion? for a way and would you now look at something like youtube and say we shouldn't have a I'll allow that to happen youtube was on debt store because of the lawsuits and the server bills. We all know that Right. Well, this is the uncertainty that's going to be created and I think this administration is creating tremendous business uncertainty I think the reaction of a lot of big tech companies is this is going to be to stop Doing m&a until the situation gets clarified because they just don't know um, you know targets are target companies are going to want to have huge breakup fees And it's just going to have a chilling effect on the market for m&a.

I mean business needs certainty and they're not giving it in this business environment About before we get to you just kind of make one point about that last clip on on the labor point Listen, this feels to me just like when the administration Uh talked about clean tech and clean energy and electric vehicles But then they only gave the subsidy to the car companies that were uh, that were basically union shops and so That's right. They excluded tesla. They excluded tesla from the e v some of they tried to pretend that ford and gm Were the ones driving the e v revolution in the u.s.

It was laughable What they were trying to do there is there were shoehorning a union agenda Into clean tech and I think that's what lina horn was doing in that clip She was shoehorning a union agenda into antitrust law and it's a bit absurd because Facebook and google even though they are very powerful companies when it comes to talent They are in a war for talent just like everybody else they compete against each other. There's not a union issue there These are not factory. These are not mistreated employees. These are very well paid employees and moreover the market is highly competitive And we don't need them trying to insert this union agenda into antitrust law You got to think that for example going back to microsoft to act division obviously the bankers Would have called apple and facebook and google as well.

I mean it's absurd that they wouldn't have Yeah, they were good at the minute that you think you have a bona fide offer One of the things you have to do is essentially, you know get an opinion letter And also to make sure that as a public market shareholder you can justify that you've evaluated all the other options, right? Sure Um, but it's really quite telling to david's point. I don't think that if you were facebook or google or apple You could have credibly made an offer because the calculus in the back if your head was not whether it had business logic But whether you could actually get it through the fdc But microsoft did because microsoft is no longer seen as a threat and yoke We said this we said this in our awards show two or three episodes ago You know, they have really been the most untouched Uh in the last decade by antitrust scrutiny whether it domestically or internationally They've largely skated under the radar after paying the price for an entire decade And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that microsoft is effectively pivoted with the exception of this gaming into being an enterprise Software company and the politicians just care a lot less about enterprise software.

It doesn't capture the public's imagination It's the big consumer You know companies that get all of that attention fascinating fascinating point like literally The consumer and the bread and circuses of this is what's driving it like People hate big tech and trump got banned from it yada yada But I gotta say, you know these um increasing restrictions on big tech and the these Prohibitions and the chilling effect the uncertainty It's one thing to do it when the market is just completely ripping and we can sort of afford To run these experiments and tinker with these these rules But I gotta say I'm I'm starting to get pretty worried here That you know, we had Jeremy Grantham is sort of a old school.

Yeah old school kind of bearish type market commentator He had this expression that the yeah, I mean it's more one of these stop clock right twice a day things Jeremy Grantham has never found a market. He didn't yeah, yeah, exactly but but but a stop clock can be right twice a day and Um, the the line he had today is that we're seeing the popping of a super bubble And you know, we've been talking about bubble. Yeah, exactly. Basically, but that's not that's not true But I mean it's good. Yes evocative Well, the the sense in which it might be true is that I mean we talked about this last few months is that you had the fed and the the the federal government Humped a 10 trillion of liquidity into the market over the past two years because of covet now They're starting to pull that back and there was I think a general asset inflation across asset classes Certain types of assets clearly got more inflated than others.

We've seen a huge correction in growth stocks We've seen a huge correction in uh in crypto basically anything long dated as the fear of interest rates increasing has gone up they've massively corrected but So the concern is that You know with the losses we're seeing And I mean every day it just keeps like you've seen more red that this could turn into a recession You know popping of bubbles is usually followed by Uh by recessions are so I think you know the fortunes of the economy could turn really quickly here And that is that is the marginal risk the marginal risk is actually for a recession We we talked about this before by the way just to your point You're right that we pumped in 10 trillion dollars But over the last three weeks and really over the last two and a half months We have actually eviscerated 10 trillion dollars of value as well.

So if you want to measure it We put 10 trillion of excess capital in but we've now destroyed 10 trillion dollars of equity destroyed it by lowering the prices or Repricing stuff. Yeah, we've repriced the crypto. I mean crypto in the last couple of days has just been Schlocked Yeah, uh growth stocks have been shellacked Um biotech stocks have been just absolutely smoked. Everything is getting crushed Uh covid stocks, but david is saying something really important the risk in my opinion is not Of runaway inflation anymore and the reason was what happened this weekend was incredibly important And we have seen this happen Just a few years ago.

So this weekend Uh china cut interest rates now As we know we are dealing in the united states with this issue of whether we should raise rates And by how much because we're worried about inflation while if you're cutting rates It's because you're worried about the other problem Which is that the economy is basically turned over and you need to become more accommodating Right, you need to incentivize businesses to spend by lowering turned over you mean It's slowed down People are not building companies not doing new projects. So you want to You want to give them an incentive or or maybe some catalyst to start some new company or start some new project because Well, the real estate projects have wound down in 2018.

Here's exactly what happened the setup was The fed we were everybody was worried about what the fed was going to do on interest rates The fed was looking at china as the canary in the coal mine the leading indicator of what we should do and at the end of 2018 Uh Jerome Powell decided to raise rates And we raised rates and then enter 2019 and the chinese economy turned over and We realized that their economy was not nearly as strong as we thought it would be And so our reaction was disproportionate to what the actual data on the ground said we entered a recession in 2019 That's when you guys probably saw Trump going crazy blaming Powell I mean most of us ignored it because you know, we were all dealing with you know, trumped arrangement syndrome But the underlying thing of what he was saying was hey, hold on a second And uh, you just caused the recession in america by raising too quickly The fed is now in this really delicate situation where china cut rates last week We have an fomc meeting the open markets committee that sets rates on wednesday.

I think of this coming week What is he supposed to do? You know bill ackman two weeks ago and was advocating for a 50 basis point raise in this meeting So that's way beyond what people even thought is supposed to do We should just remember that bill ackman has bets macroeconomic bets in the market If he's calling for a 50 point raise, I guarantee you You're gonna make a lot of money. You'll make a lot of money No conflict no interest. Yeah My only point is the setup is a very complicated one for the fed coming into this week and the risk is to a recession because if we overcorrect Yes, and the leading indicators all around the world tell us that their economies are weak Then inflation may have actually been much more transitory than we thought and right now we have to decide Because if we overcorrect, we're gonna plunge the united states economy into a recession This is why I think freedberg when you look at this when you have so many different things happening at once And you're trying to pilot a plane or a car, you know in rain on ice going really fast Maybe there's something wrong with the brakes and you got to be very delicate With you know, how you steer into this.

What is the right strategy here on a policy basis? coming out of amicron Um, should we just take a pause on raising rates? But what do you think the right situation here? Obviously putting a bunch of regulation on top of big, you know mergers and acquisitions and That's going to create headwinds. I don't know how many different variables We want to add to the mix of an economy that feels like we're in a perfect storm I don't know like a lot of us kind of talk about The valuation of things in markets is being the economy, but it's not The economy is the productivity of businesses that are valued in the market And as long as the productivity of the businesses in the market continues to improve that businesses continue to grow that There's stability to pricing that's not runaway or declining neither inflationary or 2d inflationary um You know, I think those are the indicators that matter most now the reality is over the last couple of years We've had trillions of dollars that have flowed into these markets for free And those trillions of dollars have created lots of mini asset bubbles Lots of little new markets have emerged nfts Random crypto currencies that don't actually do anything the collectibles market the art market.

There are lots of I mean there are and lots of examples of these speculative early stage businesses that have gone public And uh people backed them and they they said look when there's this much money around i'm going to start making more risky bets i'm going to make more speculative bets And uh regardless the money's coming out of the markets the money's going to come out one way or another And as it starts to come out these little bubbles are the first that are going to pop And that doesn't necessarily mean that the economy is at risk It means that there are valuation bubbles that are going to burst they're going to decline And no interest rate policy is going to change that because the inevitable growth in the underlying economy the inevitable end to the pandemic Is what's ultimately going to drive capital out of these markets and back into Ultimately more productive assets and less speculative assets And so this is a transition that i'm not sure you can really kind of manage I think underlying businesses and the growth of the economy and the ability for people to get jobs There's an incredible number of open jobs are in the u.s.

Right now three million open job listings Go apply for a job 11 million whatever it is go go go sign up for a new job three point. What is it sex three? million 3.7 percent on a point. They're not a lot of people Yeah, they're not a lot of people in the u.s. That don't have an option to go out right now and go improve their their working condition There are a lot of open jobs in the u.s. And salaries have gone up. That's what I mean You're working condition you can go make more money and um And so you know the economy underlying there are lots of great businesses that are growing and doing well And there's stability that's emerging and then there's a bunch that aren't and there are a bunch that were always speculative And that they were hyped and overvalued and you know as those assets get Evalued a lot of us that have most of our worth and income coming from capital Are uh are going to feel the burn I have two questions.

By the way that we I want to go around the horn on Uh first trimoth if we could do if each of you could do one thing to one or two things Uh to manage this economic policy in the next year. What would it be like? What two things do you think we should do David one or two things? We have a top of this that regulators should do in terms of managing this seemingly chaotic situation Just feels it just feels to me like we're pinballing from one overreaction to another So we overreacted in terms of flooding the zone with liquidity because of covet I mean remember like drunken miller You was like the one of the only voices about a year ago when they did that to that last two trillion dollar stimulus bill the covet relief bill And he said look retail is already 15 above trend meaning if you looked at demand the demand side of the economy It had fully recovered and was actually above trend people were spending more money And then we flood the zone with another two trillion and then low and behold six months later We have this inflation and then in response to that inflation.

We're now jacking up rates So quickly that I think we're risking to chamos point a recession So we're pinballing from one overreaction to another and I just the big meta thought I had this week Which is how many of our problems are just self inflicted right now? I mean even on covet, right? We could live with this variant of covet. Oh, macron You know chamos and all of our friends we've Everyone I know in the last few weeks basically has had it and it's been very mild It's basically been a cold but in large swaths of the country.

We're not choosing to live with it We're at each other's throats about these vaccine mandates these other restrictions and okay So you're no longer on and similarly and the same thing just to make even more local We've got a crime wave in america going on right now. Why because we emptied the jails last year And stop prosecuting totally self inflicted. Okay, so what things do we need to do? Just if you had one or two things that you think we should do one you said we're ping ponging So do you think more consistent policy communicating better? I don't I think that you want some neat little answer That's treatable and there is none.

No, I just wanted your let me let me explain. I thought that was a good idea There there's no one or two things anybody can do I think there's a collective set of things that we have to do in an organized way So look just to set up right We have had more activity and hedging Then in any other period in recent memory We accept the great financial crisis just to set the tone of where we are in terms of volatility in the capital markets Mutual funds who don't short stocks right the multi trillion dollar mutual fund complex whose only job is to buy has been a net seller Hasn't even started buying a single thing yet We have an fomc meeting That's going to happen next week where Jerome Paolo and the You know the Fed has to decide what to do in the face of incomplete data It's not as if we've even stopped all of the purchasing Uh of assets that we've been doing.

We're still putting money into system. I just want to be clear We were debating when we stopped the spigot We're not even debating when we shrink our balance sheet as a country so We are in a really complicated moment and I think the risk is that there is Uh an overreaction to incomplete data and we plunge the u.s economy into a recession And I just think that that that has to be really thoughtfully measured and we guys we've seen this in 2019 2018 19 I'm afraid break any thoughts. No, I'm not an economist and I'm not a central banker and so I have no clue Okay, um The the next thing I would but there but to my point I mean we are dealing with balancing the risks of inflation against the risk of recession I think that is fundamental and right now All the statements have been so hawkish that you know the markets have been just flowing red now for months and It's starting.

I think I think the the balance of risk is starting to make recession possible in a way that Didn't seem possible two three months doesn't the repricing of assets though like we look at peloton, you know It's down whatever 80 percent you look at zoom is down 70 80 percent when you see those things that were obviously mispriced Rivian, uh, which we talked about. I wouldn't use the term misprice They were I would say they're repressed the reprize they were mispriced. They're not repriced They were they someone paid someone someone someone sold them for something and nowadays they were priced against gravity Yesterday they paid 25 percent more and then today they're paying 25 percent less What difference does it make whether it's yesterday an hour ago or a year ago? Well, I mean every day pricing changes.

Well, no, here's the thing about the pricing the pricing was based on people with a lot of money placing a lot of bets Maybe who were new? Okay, fine. What's the point Jason the market condition changed? Well, I think maybe we had enthusiastic people Betting things up without looking at fundamentals is my point. I think sacks agrees with me here on this So I think you're right about that. Yeah, so now you have market participants who were gambling On like momentum now we're repricing stuff. Do we think where are we at in this repricing or correct pricing of assets? We're in the eighth in my opinion I think we're in the eighth inning of Of the tech drawdown.

So got it if you're a high growth tech company You've been smashed for three months in a row as you said Jason. We're off some stocks are off 80 You know 50 to 80 percent of their highs. That's like dot com error correction. It really is that's crash That's not coming around If you're if you're If you're in other areas like value, you've had a pretty good rally if you're in crypto You're just starting to get smoked now if you're in Why is it crypto? This is I want your thoughts on this trim up. Why is it crypto getting smoked like paletton and zoom is because those people are Holdlers or something well crypto I think has slightly different dynamics and then individual stocks like a peloton, but I think that you're gonna see It's released for one right, but you're gonna because I kept understand what all the all that the market is is who's bidding and who's coming into the market I mean, there's still thousands of millions of people from around the world stepping into the crypto markets each day That are putting more money into these markets Matt balances out the withdrawals and that's all the crypto is there's no fair underlying business that you're valuing the peloton release was really bad Okay, I mean really was very strange.

Yeah, well, I think it was strange It was just like we're just gonna basically stop producing anything Because all of our inventory will meet our demand for the foreseeable future. That's a That's not a good statement if you're supposed to be a high growth. Okay, so if we're seeing 50 to 80 percent Sacks Gavin Baker had a tweet that's capital allocator. Yeah, the bottom of the market He and it was a phrase something like when we shoot the generals and his comment was the generals are big tech when those things trade down 25% the bottom is in and I think that collectively most people think that We're a little bit oversold in all areas except big tech.

I think big tech is down 10 11 12% When you see this thing really get cracked is when those folks, you know Trade down another 10 or 15% and then I think we're kind of through most of the pain So peloton and zoom were kind of mid tech. I don't know what we call those but I would call them like mid tech They're obviously not big tech, but they're not small either mid tech gets their asses kick 50 to 80 percent big tech 15% But if big tech goes down 30% then we start really seeing a bottom and we consider netflix part of that You'll ever see that because I think big tech you have to remember is basically the index and in the last 10 or 20 years you've never seen drawdowns more than 15 to 25 percent You've never seen it and in when you've ever had a 15 to 25 percent drawdown meaning the market goes off 15 or 25 percent You have to remember the thing that we have also done over the last 20 years has created so much money on the sidelines always looking For a cheap buying opportunity and so the minute that these things so even you know in March of 2020 Remember when we started to do this pod and it literally looked like the world was ending.

Yeah, the bottom existed for a week Yep, and then within a week the entire 25% loss and the stock market was wiped out and we were back to normal So that's what I sold Okay, well, let's talk specifically about neph I think it was good that we talked about palette I had it at the Lowe's Oh my god, I did too. I remember selling I remember selling slack going This is the dumbest thing, but I have no choice because I was how about when it really goes to 15 How about when uber goes to 15 from 45? I was ready to basically curled up in a ball and said I'm not selling But I'm not feeling good right by the way I was saying Jason like any comment you made earlier.

I think you made a comment about You know, what do you do right now to drive or make change in these markets? And I'm not sure that at the end of the day The drive or the change is being made as much as the change that's being made is being driven by the market itself There is just so many dynamics at play that it's very difficult to kind of ascertain Where things are headed next what's going on and we're all gonna sit here and we're all gonna speculate We're gonna flip it coin. It's gonna come up heads.

It's gonna come up tails. We're gonna be right We're gonna be wrong It's really difficult to kind of put put our foot down and for any of us to put our foot down and say this is what I think Needs to happen and this is what I think should happen or could happen or will happen Half of us will be right half of us will be wrong but man, let's take another stock I think it's interesting to talk about this Netflix was that $700 goods. Lord a month ago. It's at 390 today This is a good one to talk about the business.

Yeah, that's like a real business that you can assess what's going on in the business itself Well, they think they're not gonna grow 2030% a year they think I grow 8 9 10 percent a year but a fabulous business, right like great business So is that now the time it's coming up much anytime Netflix is so saturated It is it has achieved such incredible market share by growing so quickly every year for years and years and end at some point The growth was gonna slow down they hit their natural audience. I think that's like I think Netflix is gonna be the best example of Consumer surplus at scale and what I mean by that is they have given so much value Away for an incredibly small amount of money like if you think about the value you get from Netflix as Compared to what you would get from a Comcast and you spend 10 bucks among $10 or $15 for net I think it's versus a hundred bucks for Comcast.

There was such a huge gap in value But Netflix had to spend so much money to keep people entertained The real question is at what point do they start to sort of like run out of the things that they can do to keep people Engaged and otherwise they Jason do what you did which is you have a subscription to HBO Max You have a subscription to Disney plus. Yeah, I mean the headwinds are the company gets in the game The only real winner is the consumer. Yeah And any individual company I think gets gets into a real tough spot And I think what you saw was their earnings release basically said just that Disney's doing a great job competing against us HBO Max is doing a great job competing against us So we're not sure with the incremental dollar that we can give you the growth that we've given you before when we had no competition And that's by the way Lena Lena cons comment Which is the other side of the coin which is when you have more competition the consumer does win it contains prices It just doesn't contain asset inflation which does impact the shareholders of these companies Yeah, and still even at this level a hundred and seventy two billion dollars.

They have a 35 X P One way that to look at this here I think your point is an interesting one Chimoth where you talk about how much value they've given away over the years and what they have today You can always look at the balance sheet of a business a public company and in the balance sheet. There's this This line good will know well not even good will just the the accumulated loss The accumulated deficit and if you look at that on Netflix They basically run the business right now as of their last earning statement Which was December 31st negative 40 million dollars So in terms of the total net cash that they've generated as a business since their founding as a business They've lost 40 million dollars.

So, you know and meanwhile the question is okay. What's the you know? So they're not necessarily at a stage where they've been generating cash But for many many years Amazon had a similar strategy where they were reinvesting all their capital Yep And that capital was going into building the business and growing the platform and adding the next layer of growth The question is has Netflix from a fundamental business perspective not a valuation perspective Have they added enough growth platforms into the business? Have they grow found enough other products services or ways they have one product They have linear video.

They don't have gaming. They don't have anything else I did start doing sports. They're not comedy. They they they are dabbling They dabbled with doing a couple of podcasts They double with doing a couple of games and there's rumors that they might try to get the other 20 or 30 percent of people Who don't pay by creating a lighter version that was ad supported in other words You're not gonna get the new season of Ozark, but maybe you can get the first two or three You're a year behind the production schedule, but you can watch it all with ads So why isn't Netflix in video games and sports? It's such an obvious one And that's why I think they released a series of games based on their IP So as their IP grows and I think that's what you'll see with Disney Plus is think about an app store inside of Disney Plus A merch store inside of Disney Plus.

I think there's so many Particles next to them. Why is there no merch store inside of it? Why don't they why don't they own Spotify or have a Spotify competitor? Well, I think Spotify sees themselves as a that's a that's a really good point You know when you look at the Peloton I was looking at the Peloton Earnings when you know, it was down 25% yesterday or the day before and I was like This is an incredible business because they have 2.1 million subscribers that pay 40 bucks a month. It's incredible I mean some money printing machine money printing machine.

I actually have a subscription I don't even have a Peloton Peloton. I don't have any just pay $500 a year to use the classes. I have the app It's crazy. I don't even use the app But I think that's 20 bucks for the just that app Yeah But the point I was trying to make is when you look at it, you know There's about 30% of that revenue that goes right back to the music labels for the music So, you know to your point like there's just an enormous value in actually music You know, so one of the great flicks built library values and content They could be they could point it to music as well There's all these things they could do to reignite growth a lot of people discount the value of having a subscription consumer business When you have a consumer's credit card on file and they're paying every month for something It's an incredible point because you don't have the friction of getting the sale done You've already done the sale.

Yep Now the question is can you upsell them some new service or some new addition that they're not paying for today? So obvious Yeah, it's so obvious, right? And so like by the way, I'll say this like for years Google struggled with this question Which is what is Google's consumer subscription business because Google did not have consumer credit cards across its platform Despite a billion daily users and so Google for years was strategically trying to figure out what business can or should we be in To have a subscription model with consumers because once you have that then you can charge for all sorts of stuff You can charge for storing photos.

You can charge for accessing audio. You can charge for accessing unlimited imagine If I'll be the I'll take the contrary inside of this. Okay. Here we go. Yeah, go ahead Peter Well, no look I invest in B2B subscription businesses I hate you to see subscription businesses and the reason is just the churn rates what we see when we look at BC subscription businesses is five percent monthly churn is not uncommon. It's pretty much the standard so Call that 50 60% churn in the subscription base every year So effectively you're rebuilding the company from scratch every two years I don't see like how you can build a successful business I'll tell you why you're wrong.

I mean doing contrast that to B2B with B2B subscription businesses You do lose some customers But the ones who stick with you keep adding seats for more employees usually and so actually Your land and expense your courts are actually your cohorts are growing 20% every year and says shrinking 50% Now, obviously there are some of these B2C subscription businesses like Netflix and Peloton. They are obviously valuable They've defy gravity. Well, Netflix has done it because they spend billions of dollars on content and Peloton's got it because they Plop a expensive machine in your house So you can't forget about it and that keeps you a little bit more recurring Then like a lot of these subscriptions, which is very easy to cancel But so look they've been able to make it work, but I'm most Here's why I think you're wrong It turns out if these are so low priced these subscriptions that you get a lot of consumers trialing them So because it's only five or ten bucks a month to use something like a Spotify or a Disney Because they're so low price you do get a little bit of Sampling and that's why the rates higher whereas in business There is a massive onboarding of people have to take their time to set up the software learn how to use it So if you're going to commit to it, it does reduce it and you do have land and expand But what we're talking about with product expansion is the equivalent in sass of land and expand So imagine if Disney plus or Spotify After you listen to an album or it's in your top rotation They showed you the merch for that band or after you completed the season of Mandalorian or bookaboba fat They showed you the merchandise and said here's a limited edition of Grogu baby Yoda when that we tried to get baby Yoda stuff last Christmas They're Disney dropped the ball.

They didn't have any and they had all that made and they would have sold millions of We were buying stuff on Etsy The reason baby Yoda works is because it's leveraged off a platform This massive Disney platform of which this B2C subscription services just one piece. I mean look obviously there are valuable consumer subscription businesses, so The way I'm approaching it can't be right in all cases However, I think people really get themselves in trouble when they start to value these B2C subscription businesses the same as The B2B ones in one case you in the B2C case churn is the predominant characteristic and it means that you're gonna have to spend more on Marketing or cogs or content or what have you to keep rebuilding the user base Whereas in the B2B context the user base is compounding on its own and that'll that just makes for I think a more Yes, attractive business opportunity.

Yes, but it grows slower again. Just at the end of the day These are all variables. Just the weights just changed I agree with David that consumer churn businesses or consumer businesses have much higher churn than enterprise and enterprises have negative churn Which means that they just naturally grow But the reality is consumers just have an unbounded tam that enterprises do not and the way that the way that the LTV's work Just tend to be different and the cash flow cycle of these companies tend to be very different And that's why you see Netflix get these enormous valuations that enterprise subscription businesses do not what some people are now doing when they look at Consumers and consumer businesses They look at churn is they take out the ones that are based on credit card to look at like people who actually Unsubscribe because they don't want it but not because their credit card right so basically so if you think about like Netflix's business If it's turning two and a half percent per month, that's called that 30% of the user base is a treating every year They've got to rebuild their user base from scratch every three or four years now They can do that.

I guess at some point though, they may run out of You know Greenfield Opportunity to grow their customer base But you know, it's gonna pressurize their margins because they're gonna have to constantly Spend on content original content to retain you They're gonna have to spend on marketing to keep going after the portion Yeah, but the archive you're you're leaving out the archive these archives are gonna be super valuable And I don't think we even know how to value These archives yet because if you look at the Marvel archive or the Star Wars archive These things just keep printing money year after year and then you'll see Netflix and HBO Max We'll keep being able to go back to them HBO Max being the canonical example now because you didn't think that that business would have You know a lot of IP to build on but suddenly you have the many saints of newer And the sex in the city reboot.

I mean they're going right down. There's gonna be When you own the franchise it has value Disney has shown that you own the best franchises HBO Max is now showing it and then that means Netflix will show it next How much of a Netflix's content do they even own are they like now? No now? It's a hundred percent Netflix is a hundred percent they stopped and that's why Disney started taking it off Their their whole spend that I think they're spending 20 billion or something. It's all on original content So that's why they made that move is because they knew they were gonna have the Disney content the Marvel content pulled Where do we want to go next guys because I have COVID I Wanted I want I want sacks to talk to me about his What's going on with Fauci? Oh? My gosh, this is quite a story.

This really is I'm trying to get my head around the story I'd be totally honest. I had to slow it down explain it to us because I think yeah, please my head is spinning Okay, so a series of emails have come out that were requested of the Freedom of Information Act and what they show is that At the NIH Fauci and Francis Collins who was ahead of it They had a series of conversations with scientists around January sorry a January 31st or February 1st There are emails on February 1st Summarizing those conversations and basically what they say is that a group of scientists advised from Fauci and Collins that COVID likely came from a lab how they know because it had you know Hallmark signatures like the furan sites the same reasons we now believe The virus came from a lab.

Okay, but by February 4th officials at so three days later officials at the NIH including Fauci had come to the conclusion that The virus must have been passed zoonotically from an animal like a pangolin It didn't come from the lab and furthermore they were starting to use language like conspiracy theory to discredit The the the lab leak the lab leak idea so that within a few days they were all in on this sort of so called zoonotic theory and They really began a Campaign in the words of Collins a devastating takedown of scientists who were trying to discuss the lab leak theory that became the official position Why why well, okay, so this is where it gets really interesting Obviously, I can't speculate to modus, but here's what we know the NIH Fauci's division There years ago there was a debate in the scientific community about how we study Viruses Fauci's an epidemiologist.

He wants to study them makes sense the debate is Over whether you should enhance the viruses as a way to study them so called gain of function research there Fauci is on the side of Engaging in that kind of research. There are other scientists who think it's crazy. They lose The NIH then makes grants to a group called the eco health alliance is run by a British scientist named Peter Dazza Okay, by the way, who doesn't who doesn't support eco health and an alliance? Branding yeah, and we love puppies. Yeah, we're yes Angel puppy love.

Yes, exactly. So so eco health alliance, which is has neither been good for the ecology for our health or Or alliances yeah people have bad names for alliances everywhere. Yes So they then provide funding to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to study bat viruses where Getting a function research then occurs this lab in Wuhan is known to have had leaks in the past So just from a security choice not the best recipient of a grant But that is what happens. Okay, and then we know the history from there. It's almost certain that What's the what's the element of the story that has to deal with the Lancet and the yes I'll tell you that worked for Fauci and then And then that person got a grant afterwards what well and then just one other thing I want to point out here So we're clear this has become a very partisan issue, but the original foes were done by Buzzfeed and The Washington FOIA sorry the FOIA releases were done by Buzzfeed and Washington Post And now you have Rand Paul on the other side of it who seems like really wacky and obviously conspiracy right wing So you have this like really weird partisanship that's now been embedded in it.

Okay? Yes So can you explain the partisan nature and then I was a question I almost want to take a chamos question first about Who is this Dasek guy? What is this Lancelot? Let me come back to the partisan thing I'm just gonna try to stop us with facts before we get into the partisan mess of this thing So Peter Dasek is the guy who made these grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Okay? There is one other interesting fact when the West wanted to come in and investigate what happened in this lab China approved one person from the West to come in and conduct the investigation.

Guess who that was? Peter Dasek. Okay. He was the only guy The CCP led in to go look at this lab He then comes out of this whatever he did and says it has to be the zoonotic theory. He endorsed the wet market idea It cannot be lab leak That is a conspiracy theory and then he Rounds up a group of scientists to write a letter to the Lancet Which is a respected scientific publication which incredibly respected. Yes, which he signs in which he basically advocates the zoonotic theory But he goes further and says there is no way That it could be lab leak and anyone who says as a conspiracy theorist and that has an incredibly chilling effect On the scientific community because no scientist wants to be labeled a kook or conspiracy theory or heretical to the Lancet Exactly and this is a tight knit ecosystem of of Insiders insiders and institutions and grants no scientists wants to lose their funding, right? And then furthermore big tech starts censoring his disinformation the lab leak theory because they say well these officials Look at all the scientists.

We have to follow the science, right? So the science according to this letter from the Lancet is Basically on the side of the zoonotic theory. So you then have downstream censorship of this So that is who Peter Dasek is and and and in this letter in the Lancet He never disclosed his conflict of interest, which is the fact that he funded This Wuhan Institute of virology to conduct the type of research that might have led to the leak of the virus So this guy is hopelessly conflicted and has a reason to want to suppress and cover up a lab leak And he never disclosed it and look so does Fauci.

I mean because Fauci funded Dasek so imagine when in February of 2020 when the lab leak is coming across the desk of Fauci Does he tell the president mr. President? He's at the right hand of the president mr. President We might have funded this thing we funded Dasek who funded the Wuhan lab We Collectively the United States government might have some responsibility in this. Do you think that conversation ever took place? When he was making his recommendations He was hopelessly conflicted and if the truth about this had come out and look I'm not saying he had any intentional role.

I'm not saying he wanted this to happen I'm not even saying that he knew for sure that Dasek was funding the Wuhan lab Okay, let's just give Fauci the benefit of the doubt But we all know how politics works if it had come out in February of 2020 that Fauci had funded the guy who funded the Wuhan lab And that's where the virus likely came from his career would have been finished. Okay finished We know that as a political reality and so within days of scientists advising Fauci Hey, this thing probably came from the lab the NIH has consolidated around The idea that this is a conspiracy theory and they work to suppress it and they wage a public campaign I got to tell you when I have learned all these facts.

I got to tell you what I compare it to It's almost like we learned all those revelations about Bill Cosby that here's this guy on TV for years Pretending to be America's dad and then we find out he's a monster Fauci has been on TV for years lecturing us about COVID He's been like America's dad America's doctor and lo and behold We find out that he has a role in this whole thing and look I'm not saying his intent was not to Intent has People so it's a little bit of a I'm gonna give him the benefit of every doubt here.

I'm gonna give him the benefit of every doubt. Okay, just called them Bill Cosby I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt in the sense that he didn't want this to happen He didn't have any he didn't cause that but we know for a fact that he funded does a coup fund to this lab It's where the virus came from come on. We know that and he covered it up. He engaged in a campaign Okay, we suppress the lab leak theory. There is a conflict of interest. Let's get let's get free beginning on the science What do you think as some a man of science Friedberg the Sultan of science in fact about These emails and the chances that Fauci essentially was Funding gain of research and then attempting to cover it up Which is a question of science.

I look there I mentioned this in the past Jamie science community, you know, Jamie Metzal did a Podcast interview with likes Friedman. It's worth listening to it's a couple hours long if you got some time to kill But he does a good job contextualizing these matters and what may have gone on that led ultimately to The the lab leak and also the lab leak cover up. I don't know what happened with Fauci emails. I have not read this stuff so I You know, I have no reason to believe that Fauci is now intentioned in the sense that he has some reason to harm or hurt I could see that There is a certain degree of nervousness to accuse the biggest foreign government and potential US adversary Causing a global pandemic and not wanting that sort of conflict to arise at a period of time when you really need to take care of your People and we really need to focus internally the country on how do we get through this pandemic and making that I have to respond to that I'm not saying that Fauci or anyone involved in that process should have accused China, but that's not what was Their decision that what was not was debated.

They decided to stop the debate altogether They decided to suppress the debate. What would you have done in that seat sacks? You're sitting in that seat and the country is potentially facing a pandemic that could wipe out millions of Americans. I'll tell you Where do you prioritize? I'll tell you what if I was sitting at the NIH and I wasn't hopelessly conflicted. I would probably have just said listen I don't know what the origin of the virus is let that debate continue I would not have tried to wage a public campaign Against the people against the scientists who were honestly Pursuing in good faith where this virus might have come from so we can learn things maybe how to avoid something like this from happening again The people at the NIH should not have engaged in that type of politically minded PR campaign They just shouldn't that's not their job as scientists and then to find out that they have a conflict of interest on top of that That might be motivating that desire That is not that is not appropriate.

I think it's really important freeberg. You can probably agree with this that at some point some journalist should really simplify this for all of us because it's it's a It's an incredibly important Topic that we need to look at at the end of all of this assuming that Amicron is the end of this chapter because it's been a horrible chapter for the world But we do need an accounting of the truth, right? I think that that's really important There was an episode many ago when I said I don't know and I don't care about whether or not the virus came out of China and Again, I was somewhat kind of misstated as the intention of why I said that the reason I said that and what I really meant Was that what happened? Even if it was a lab leak what happened was really the tip of the iceberg The ability to bioengineer pathogenic organisms is becoming ubiquitous The toolkit to do gain of function research as it's being called in the press is a very simple toolkit The ability to engineer organisms that can cause catastrophic harm to the human species is Becoming available on the internet and with tools that any of us can buy and use in our garage And so what I'm more questioning and what I'm more concerned about and what I care more about is what is our global bio defense strategy? How are we getting ahead of the next wave of this happening? And it's not about the who said he said she said those things It's really important to understand We need bio defense when they're saying it came zoonotically They're saying it came from an animal when actually was created in the lab If you want to have bio defense, we got a first say that it Whether it did or did yeah, you're right whether it did separate question to me Whether it did or didn't the tooling to do this is absolutely possible and the ability for these sorts of viruses to leak out and be made and And turned into a weapon is significant.

It's a real risk. And so I'm worried guys I think both of you guys are saying how do we solve this problem like I'm right. Yeah, yeah, but both of you guys are but both of you guys are saying nuanced versions of David is saying we have to have an honest accounting of what happened if we could if we're supposed to actually have an eco health alliance Yeah, by the way, I'm not I'm not you're saying yeah. Yeah, I'm not just making not dismissing that yeah, and you're saying We need to actually formalize gain of function research because Everybody has it and so it's going to be inappropriate for us to ignore it We need to assume game of the function research leads to dangerous pathogenic bio organisms And then we need to cancel the other and then we need to formulate I doesn't and then we need to formulate a bio defense strategy I'm just saying like we don't the implication the reason why sacks is thing is important to me is the implications We have to have an honest accounting of these implications.

We saw another implication just this week in Flint, Michigan. They shut down indefinitely the public school system in Flint, Michigan Okay, this is a society just to give you a sense of the facts here 90% our minority 80 why did they shut it down because of over because of COVID because of the fear of catching COVID and spreading COVID But the 90% are minority kids 80% are in poverty. I don't know how you know 80% of kids who are in poverty are expected to have a laptop and internet access on a consistent basis This is the same place that screwed up the water system.

So I don't I so I think like we have to have an honest accounting of Of all of these things because the implications are real This is the biggest story of our lifetimes COVID I mean, it might be the biggest international incident since World War two and the fact that The major let's call it prestige publications have not really fully investigated hold on I think this is is unbelievable. I'm under him to me because this started with A massive amount of coverage from Buzzfeed Washington Post New York Times in June of last year 2021 they were covering this like crazy about it a fair did a major investigation and then it seems to have gone silent And then Rand Paul has been going after this and it all the sudden became partisan So the only coverage I'm seeing of it is that's independent as the intercept But then everything else is the hill and you know really weird far right stuff that want to like, you know Fauci needs to be whatever and how did it become so partisan if it started with left leaning publications? Getting this information sacks like how did this become partisan is because the president changed in the middle of all this like what? Do you have an honest handicapping of why we can't get? You know like a consensus on what's actually happening here from the press is it Rand Paul's to polarizing? Well, I think what happened is if you go back to February of 2020 If you look I just had this conversation with Ashley Runesburg on my Colin show and you know, he's Pluggy now available Can I he literally wrote the book on the New York Times and I asked him about their coverage of You can trade that I Robert So fine, can I can I finish? This is the guy who literally this is the guy who literally wrote the book on The New York Times and I asked him about the New York Times coverage of of COVID and COVID origins He says that on February 17th.

So basically two weeks after these officials at the NIH settle on the conspiracy theory narrative that That narrative is then published almost word for word verbatim using the same language Not just the New York Times in the Washington Post across all these major publications. So what you see there is a PR campaign It's a concerted effort You don't get the same words and language being used across all the major publications at the same time Unless somebody is pushing that narrative. We all know this. This is corporations do this, right? They run PR campaigns. That is what basically happened.

And so the prestige media got on board this Zoonotic theory and this idea look like they've done so many times they got on board WMD in Iraq before Realizing it was a total farce and a hoax. Okay, they so they got themselves on record behind this conspiracy theory idea and similarly I Think the Democrats got themselves on record as being profouchie and everything Because of you know, TDS right anyone who's standing up to Trump must be correct and defended and so all of this happened in 2020 and so by the time we now fast forward to let's call it an honest Investigation of the origins the virus which should be bipartisan.

This should not be partisan We should all want to know what happened We should all want to take the politics out of it because without knowing what happened How do we prepare for it in the future? Everyone's already like hopelessly committed to positions they took in 2020 and I think this was driving the partisanship Yeah, I think you're right Yeah, I mean that's the thing I'm trying to get to is like when I saw you wanted to put it on the docket I'm like trying to grok this and I can't find I'm finding all the Left leaning coverage from June of 2021 None since then and then it's all right coverage now and I think it's something we need to get Some independent coverage with so I'll take credit.

I'll take credit for saying Fauci is the biggest political loser at our all in Podcast recap. Thank you. I'll take my bow now. I mean and the the other thing that's kind of I have come to already. I mean, I know we're so correct on these things the thing that's I think just Furiating right now is that everybody is trying to manipulate the public and They have not Understood that in this media environment the truth comes out Kind of not only eventually but pretty quickly So stop trying to game the public either way that the vaccines don't work Jason delay they've delayed the public reckoning on this by what like two years well here's anything There's a so I agree with you on that There's also a for release that happened in the UK where and it's a little too much to get into right now But this for release now is looking at all the people who died in the UK of COVID And it turns out like maybe more people are dying because they didn't get their cancer or a large number of people died because they didn't go in to get tested for cancer and all of this is gonna come out eventually and Not putting out every day the ages And the comorbidities of people who died of COVID just led to this feeling that we're getting gamed and turning on CNN and seeing the Case counts in a cumulative chart is like a startup giving me like the cumulative number of people who registered for their Company but for their product.

We don't care about that. We want to know your daily active users What about what about the catastrophic impact of school closures that we've been talking about in the show repeatedly? I only see manipulated stop manipulating the public look you have to realize that there is huge political motivations here because huge CYA going on because the heads of the teachers union said there is no learning loss They are the ones who lobby to shut the schools down. They sure as hell aren't gonna admit their mistake now They're covering it up. And so any politician who takes their money is basically they're gonna muffle their criticism There's only one really honest like left wing guy.

I've seen acknowledge the school closure issue Which was Jonathan Chait had a great article in New York magazine Saying that progressives must acknowledge the mistake of school closures because otherwise we can't learn from it He has been a voice in the wilderness on that side of the aisle. We got a wrap up now that sacks has cracked open the plugs What are we all working on because I want to give a plug to Friedberg who did a great interview On a tech podcast called this week and startups where he announced Hannah So it's a dual plug here Friday's episode of this week startups Maybe you could tell us a little bit about the launch of of Canada your new Replicator, we're just announcing the business Which I talked about a lot on Jason's pod so definitely worth hearing But as you guys know, I've talked a lot about this concept of decentralized manufacturing where we can kind of move Old school industrial production systems, which are super inefficient.

We use lots of resources move stuff into factories process them and then ship the products back out and You know technology now allows us to have more distributed or decentralized manufacturing Potentially so what you know what we've been working on for three years at this point is a company called canna, which is really that you know Printing beverages in your home so you can use a single device to print ice coffee or iced tea Cocktail juice wine soda Etc all using a single flavoring system and water from your from your sink We talked more about it on the pod, but I think this is a big theme You know forget about canna for a second But generally like the systems of old like you know the industrial revolution created all these old school systems that are big contributors to carbon emissions and are super resource inefficient And I do think that everything from 3d printing to bio manufacturing to the system that we kind of introduced today with canna Can completely reinvent our global industries in different ways And ultimately lead to cheaper products better products and products that use much less natural resources and put less carbon out And so it's been a big thing that we've been working on I'm excited to kind of open it up a little bit and talk more about what we're doing So thanks for having me on the canna.com.

Did you hire the Muth as a spokesperson? You may or may not have his brand on here. We'll see there were so right now the business is Is signing up lots of different folks that can create digital beverage brands And so if any of you guys want to have jacals, you know, hard cider hard cider Here we go. We'll be launching that but that's a big part of our work Actually told me his new his new soda that he's gonna be bringing it's called it Muth cola it has five times the sugar of Coca Cola other than that It's just like any other colder, but you get five times the calorie if you rips out like maple syrup Hey, I'd like to I'd like to do a I I'm sorry project.

No, but I want to I want to say it again in Genesee County in Michigan Flint Indefinitely shut down their public schools this week. What is going on? You have thousands of kids Who at best will have to learn via zoom and internet access that most of these kids may or may not have because again You know, they're they're in poverty and so I just want to make sure that everybody just understands that everybody tweet that and Inflicted wounds. Well, here's the thing the kids these kids This is one of Eric Adams 90 90 percent minority 80 percent in poverty All virtual until further notice.

Well, here's what's gonna happen to it goes right against the CDC guidelines okay, and this is really the accounting of the cost and We are as we've said before learning loss in our kids is going to be the single biggest thing We look back in 20 years coming out of this pandemic and realize was the the the biggest price we paid for this so Here's the stupidity of it the what the and Eric Adams and the in the New York City You know sort of leadership We're talking about this when these kids are in school Okay, there's a chance to get on the ground like everybody got on the ground like everybody has it now Like it's crazy how many people in our circle have it the only person who doesn't have his fill him you now What's gonna happen when they go home or they're not in school and they're hanging out with their friends or looking for something They're gonna get it anyway What I'm said is that school is the safest place for them to be yes Totally School shutdowns are just so insane to me right now UNICEF had an article which I'll dig up where they said that the cost in future earnings by this generation of students Who suffered learning loss is gonna be 17 trillion Worldwide that's gonna be the economic impact from this thing not to mention the Stunted individual emotional development by locking these kids down for anxiety PTSD I mean this is gonna create depression in kids We need to solve this we got it.

We gotta get that we gotta get the schools and Flint open all right everybody for the dictator Chumoff polyhop a Tia I'm David Friedberg the Sultan of science and the Rain Man himself David sacks. I'm Jake. How will see you next time? You should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all I'm doing
