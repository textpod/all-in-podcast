Duration: 37 minutes, 59 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

All right, what oh I'm doing this again. All right, listen, it's a two parter you read you listen to the first part now This is the second part episode 76 point five if you will This is our first ever two parter part two of our two parter you already listened to part one of episode 76 That's Elon and Twitter lots of details there and now we're gonna cover some more topics including the global food crisis China's plan to stockpile a bunch of food geopolitics all around the horn French election Germany Etc and then we're going to details about a little bit of the drama and details pageant tea parties poker all the good stuff of the all in summit Coming soon okay enjoy the show There's still a war raging, but I wanted to get an update from freeberg on the food crisis which he Predict it very early furler Furture fertilizer prices are still climbing like crazy There's been some food riding in China, which I think is a separate issue he'll educate us in a minute Sri Lanka So what is your theory of what we're gonna do from here freeberg because I think we're all waiting for this Shoot a drop and I think you predicted this is something that we would experience into the fall and into next year so When are we gonna actually see these food riots occurring and then is China's food rights have anything to do with this or does that have to do with a Yeah, I would put the Chinese food riots as kind of a separate localized supply chain problem related to the lockdowns But we're definitely You know, I think I mentioned last week the USDA planting report showing in the US how acreage is being reduced on corn and and And we're seeing this around the world where acres are coming out of production or less fertilizers being used which means less food's being made So everything that we predicted I mean, this is a slow train a Titanic into the iceberg that we're watching right now And it's gonna continue for nine to 18 months So, you know one of the questions that people are now asking which I said, you know Would become a really critical next step in this crisis is how are we gonna bridge the gap in calories? Where's the food gonna come from and how are we gonna feed nations that are almost entirely dependent on imports They're running out of food or out of food.

So I've mentioned this in the past the whole world runs on a 90 day food supply Which means roughly 25% of the world's calories are in storage right now, but that's not the case Uniformly so some countries like Tunisia and Somalia Ethiopia have close to zero calories in storage some countries like United States are roughly, you know, 30 40% of our, you know, annual consumed calories are sitting in storage China is a complete outlier for years. China has been stockpiling food and at this point China has a hundred and fifty percent of their annual consumption of food in Storage so they have supplies that if all food production and imports stopped in China They would be able to feed their population for one and a half years.

That's an incredible supply of food So as you look around the world to places like Sri Lanka and places like Somalia They're struggling to figure out how are we gonna bridge this gap on calories? That's about to hit us Egypt's about four months of food by the way and Egypt is dwindling They cannot get the food out of the Black Sea so China is gonna be one of the very few Potential solutions for bridging the calorie gap over the next year and I have a strong prediction and a strong belief that Because of that China will use it to maximal leverage and we will see over the next year an Incredible amount of leverage and power being accumulated by China Because of transactions that they're gonna start to enter into to bridge the calorie gap around the world So in the Horn of Africa, for example, there has been this continuous presence of China trying to give themselves a military base trying to take Some influence over local media And there's been this kind of push and pull with certain populations around whether or not we should kind of embrace China locally And I think that for example the the food crisis that we're seeing emerge in Ethiopia Somalia Eritrea Djibouti Is going to be resolved by China and China is gonna end up gaining influence gaining military presence and Establishing a more permanent foothold in the Horn of Africa Because of the position that they're in of strength with all these calories and the and the need in these regions That's not just there Sri Lanka other parts of Southeast Asia Even Western Africa Northern Africa China is gonna show up and They're the only country that can't show up the UN the World Food Program They're gonna do everything they can to shuffle calories around change food supplies But I do think that one of the things that everyone's gonna be watching and it's it's a slow roll This isn't gonna be some one big deal and everyone wakes up over the next year While the US is you know trying to do everything we can to maximally impose sanctions on Russia China is slowly turning the crank around the world on the influence that they are going to gain because of this food crisis and the absolute You know surplus that they have locally and the ability to export that surplus to support needs around the world and it's not gonna be free It's not gonna be cheap So I thought it was worth highlighting what we're seeing and I shared a couple of articles with you guys and with Nick Articles that no one is paying attention to and this isn't some conspiratorial.

Oh my god. There's some dangerous thing happening I'm just pointing out one of the things that's happening as we talk about You know the great change in power the shift in power globally that's happening it is happening in a very significant way this year Given the surplus that China has the dirt that many countries have and the inability for the US to really adequately respond to the food crisis That that's emerging and so I thought it was worth bringing to everyone's attention There's a lot of little articles that support this point I shared them with you guys you guys can put them in the show notes and and put them up on YouTube and whatever But I think this is gonna become a macro trend that we're gonna wake up to in six to nine months and be like whoa What the heck happened? You know how did China get so much leverage around the world and it's starting now That's what happens with every war.

You know we all we go in hot You know we you know raw raw we're all gung ho and then at some point in time. We're like wait a second Why do we do that? You know? And you know and look there's no shortage of Neocons and liberal interventionists are all saying this war is wonderful for us because it's reunited the American Alliance and the Western Alliance And that this has been this war is a good thing for us. Let's keep it going. Let's bleed Russia Let's topple Putin. Let's debit stabilize the regime They're in favor of protracted conflict that I've been you know warning against and what freeberg is saying is the longer This conflict goes on the more of these two disaster scenarios are gonna materialize What are you what is your take on? How crippled Putin is right now David just objectively and again, you're not a fan of Putin Like I mean this does not look good for him It feels like he can't and he's losing all his tanks.

I mean this seems like a I don't know anything You don't know in terms of you know, I'm just a consumer of information But I tend to think that we are overly optimistic in the West and look the war has clearly gone very bad for Putin But this idea that everything that magically we're gonna get regime change in Moscow. We're gonna get Gorbachev 2.0 That that is that is an objective worth Portracting this war for I tend to think it's gonna be a mistake. I mean that that's now Doesn't mean I support Russia's invasion. I've said it's illegal.

It's a crime It's an inviolation of international law. It's a humanitarian disaster but what I've supported is a Is a negotiated peace a settlement that we try to get as quickly as possible That is clearly not the administration's position on this they want to keep this thing going and you know this idea that though that a long war is good for America's alliances I would disagree with that because you're already seeing all Over the world now people are starting to object to American policy you saw it with India and India is the world's largest democracy.

They should be on our side They definitely should not be on China's side because they have a huge They're not late intention, but China and India are both de facto on Russia's side of this Africa and large parts of Latin America would like to have oil And they would like to maintain their they would like to maintain their relationship with Russia and they did not support the Denunciation of Russia they would like to see this conflict to end Large parts of Africa would like to see it end Latin America. Basically all the victims If there's a famine in the world in six months like freeberg is saying they are all very worried about this All of them have expressed concern with the American policy which seems to be to protect this war Okay, and freeberg you have to go do your talk at Berkeley.

Congratulations, and we'll see you next time. Thanks for the contribution Shemath any thoughts on the CPI we set a record that seemed to have gotten lost in the the haze of Twitter I learned I learned something really interesting that I just wanted to share with you guys So there was a big CPI print obviously, but there was a report probably not many people read it but it was about home equity and The takeaway was that since 2020 Americans have taken two four hundred and thirty. I think the exact number is four hundred and twenty seven Four hundred and twenty seven billion dollars of home equity out of their homes and effectively spent it So what it what it started to make me think about was if you look at all of that home equity Plus the stimmy checks plus the unemployment insurance checks that Starts to explain.

I think why the labor markets are so tight and why people haven't gone back to work There is no motivation because there's just so much money sloshing around For them to basically not have to be forced to do any of this stuff that they don't want to anymore and I think the the thing to keep in mind is like that's also what's gone into the stock market It's also what's driven up the price of used cars new cars all of this stuff. I Just think that kind of like starts to paint a picture of CPI that's really important Which is that it's probably a little bit more transitory Then we may actually think because when you exhaust all of that extra money that try power There's not as much inflation to be had and I think most people are now forecasting that inflation is really going to taper off and The big warning sign that everybody is sort of you know marching towards is you know Too many excessive rate hikes between now and the end of the year could actually push us into a real recession And we were talking about that before but the probability is now sort of like one in three Whereas before I think you know David and I sounded a little bit crazy when we were talking about it So I just wanted to put that out there as something I learned this week that I thought was really important We're the labor participation rate peaked at 67 68% But half a trillion dollars at home equity I mean half a trillion dollars of actual spending in the economy That's a ton of money to be absorbed right if people have a couple hundred grand in their bank account who own homes or whatever There's no need to go back to a job and if you don't feel safe because you maybe still have some COVID fears You don't want to commute or you just out of the rhythm for two years And you're like I'm kind of enjoying skiing or whatever you're doing whatever your jam is maybe there's no There's no rush to get back.

You'll wait until you you'll wait until you exhaust all of that money This is a and then we're not as we talked about we're not letting people into the country at the same time So you still have 10 million job openings That flips that would be economic activity that would be helpful in fighting fighting against a Recession correct. I mean, I think that that we're probably gonna have a quarter or two contraction It's probably gonna happen at sort of at the late end of this year beginning of next year just the real question is how How high our rates between now and then and again, I think the setup isn't very good, which is that the investors in the stock market are playing chicken with the Fed and You know, they're just at the beginning of a rate cycle and they haven't been able to impact any real forms of liquidity in the equity market And so I think they're gonna they're going to attack That and the only blunt force instrument they have is rates and so, you know, you could see rates at three three and a half percent And that's gonna impact a lot of stuff and the problem is that you know It's going to be after the economy has slowed down because it's going to be after a lot of these You know fake savings if you will have been depleted.

Yeah, we're seeing some pressure come off as well The car shortage is kind of ending And wages have raised so that it seems like they're in in this You know confluence of events certain things are starting to work themselves out. Are you Hey, can I tell you something else? I was I was in Washington this week the new Number of people that listen to our pod it is Incredible I mean saying yeah, how many incredible Washington care about our views on politics. It's incredible the number of feedback to yeah It's really really really special. We've we've stumbled into something pretty cool and the fact that it's like must it's it's it's Must listening it's must listen at this like a Sunday weekly show you just get a different perspective from yeah The tech sector and capital allocators that maybe you don't get on us, you know meet the press or something Yeah, but just to follow up on that inflation point the economic point Jason if I can so please So look the main reason inflation is going to go down in the second half of this year is because inflation is measured on a year over Your basis and you remember about a year ago is when inflation started But you know around this time last year inflation is only two and a half percent then it reached five percent by the summer Then by the end of the year was almost eight percent So as we sort of lap last year's inflation rate, we come up against, you know, you're copying against 7.8

percent number last year so I don't think inflation is gonna get any better We're probably looking at roughly a 12 percent You know official two year inflation number So in other words since Biden took over as president You're looking at probably 12 to 13 percent of total inflation is measured by CPI And that is why even though the headline number will come down later this year I don't think the American people are gonna feel any better about the situation You can almost predict that Jen Psaki or whoever replaces her at the podium at the White House briefing room They're gonna be touting these lower inflation numbers at the end of the year But it doesn't mean price levels will have decreased prices will still be very high when people go to the grocery grocery store They buy meat or bread or what have you it's gonna be very expensive And I don't think people are gonna be feeling better off and there's gonna be a lot of Negativity going into the November election for this administration.

I'm also I think it's gonna impact consumption I mean if you're going to a gas station and you I mean I drove the minivan to LA And it's the only electric it's only non electric car We have we happen to drive it because we had a number of people that was bigger than the X and It was like shocking to buy $7 gasoline and obviously I can withstand You know filling up, but I could see people saying, you know what maybe I'm not gonna make that incremental trip or You know, you start looking at some of the prices You know for taking a trip or flights I don't know if you've looked at flights or hotels like things are starting to creep up that it's like super noticeable And that's got to affect consumption and then that would be what would be part of those negative two quarters, right? I mean the role of people stopping consuming and just saying you know what it's too expensive right now Just I'll stay at home and watch Netflix.

Fuck it. You know, I'll cook pasta tonight. You see that happening already Yeah, people are starting to balance the balance sheet just looking at the balance sheet and saying you know what what's a way I can You know cut some expensive items off the you know, I'll ride a bike They're gonna take less travel because you know the cost of airline tickets have gone up because the cost of the jet fuel has gone up But all it all ripples through the economy. But I think the thing is that when When the Fed gets involved though, they get involved in you know in a brute force way Let me make a prediction right now if we're we're definitely headed into an economic slowdown I don't know if it will meet the technical definition of recession, but very negative course of growth.

Yes, exactly So I you know very high chance I think of recession like Jama said towards the end of the year if this war is still going on and we get in a recession Look out below. I think this president will be in Jimmy Carter territory. He began the year at 38% That was in reasonably good conditions of peacetime if you know, and I tweeted at the beginning of the year in January I said that you know, this is you know, you're at 38% That's with peace and prosperity. Look out below if we get recession or war.

That's what it's looking like right now So You know, I think this is things are looking pretty pretty dire Which is why I keep saying it, you know The policy this administration should be to try and find a settlement to the situation in Ukraine to this war I know that we didn't start it Putin started it. Let's be clear But if there's an off ramp here, we should be seizing it because we got real problems Back home in America and the administration should be focused on our economy and our problems Europe is going to be the canary in the coal mine on all of this because I think they feel this pretty severely and I think there's a A lot of exhaustion amongst European governments and leaders when you start to listen to this rhetoric To kind of you know find a way to end and what's going on over there because the They're gonna see a Pretty meaningful recession.

I think yeah, absolutely much more much more so than we will yeah And if you look if you look right now what's happening in France Marine Le Pen is surging unbelievable Again, it's Macron. I don't know if she's gonna pull off the upset but one of the major pillar. Well, actually here's what she's running on She is saying that she has been focused on Inflation and cost of living and she says Macron has been distracted by being America's basically Lapdog puppet whatever on Ukraine So she's saying we need to focus on the French economy and she's also saying that we as France should set our own Foreign policy and not be so differential to the US.

She says that this protracted war in Ukraine and all this hot rhetoric Coming out of the Biden administration about war crimes and Destabilizing Putin and toppling him and putting him on trial at the Hague that is not in French interests That's what the Americans want to do, but it's not what we should be wanting to do We need to end this war and I'm not ready to say she's gonna pull off the upset yet But she is clearly Articulating that message because she is finding purchase with the French electorate based on that message And you're gonna hear that if this war continues for three months and six months and Europe goes into a recession You're gonna start hearing Politicians all over the European continent saying the same thing and questioning American leadership And why are they are dragging this thing out the thing that's the scariest thing about the French election And I'm not sure how many Americans paid attention to it But just to maybe summarize in a very quick nutshell you actually had this really interesting dynamic of three candidates one was what would be considered far left Jean Luc Mélenchon one far right Marine Le Pen and then one that was very very centrist Emmanuel Macron and What's crazy is both of these two Were you know 22 plus percent of all of the votes It was just that Le Pen and Macron were one and two and so they go into a runoff election And you know Mount Shawn was very clear.

He was like under no circumstance should any of my supporters vote for Le Pen But it just shows you what's happening, which is like France which is You know sort of coming undone under this populist fight is probably a Canary in the coal mine for how this stuff could play out in other places and it's kind of scary It'd be interesting to see what happens in Germany as well as they look at this enabling of they were able to hold the line They you know, they still have a center right government, but you know in Austria for a while.

That wasn't the case in Hungary It's not really the case So there's a lot of countries at least in the Eastern Bloc of Europe where you've you've seen a tip in one direction or the other It's not unreasonable to think of that in France. It could tip in one direction or the other Fortunately in the UK or unfortunately, however you look at it. It's still really a two party system for the most part I think So I don't know. We're in a really precarious moment in world history. I think Yeah By the way, I want to talk about one thing that I thought at the end of last year.

I talked about just a very random thing about you know Visa and Mastercard and how you could short them Or you know like basically like the payment networks. We're gonna start to get you know dismantled this year It's really interesting to see I don't know if you guys have been really paying attention to all the activity That's been happening in payments over like the last Literally 90 days. I think has been really incredible up into you know, just today, you know visa and Mastercard I think are doing the single dumbest thing they could do by being a duopoly which is raising prices especially into an inflationary moment which just lacks complete Knowledge and sensitivity of the moment so dampen economic activity But also creates the incentives for disruption Sure, right because then the gap between you and your next clear as competitor becomes more obvious and again in capitalism You compete away these advantages and I just think that The setup is becoming more and more obvious for the shift in payments.

I just think it's quite interesting So dick Durbin actually today basically is gonna create a big, you know hubbub in the Senate around these increasing merchant fees Which will eventually spill over to consumers There's some talk that you know, I What is it called Zelle? Is that I pronounce it Zelle the the the the inner bank payment system people are talking about them converting that to becoming a more Substantive payment system and then this week. I Was able to see a little bit under the hood of you know, Solana pay And that's really exciting so it's all coming I think like it's like a swarm of activity To dismantle these payments businesses.

I just wanted to just give the 90 day update from our from our discussion in January All right, everybody We will see you May 15th 16th and 17th in Miami for the first all in summit now sold out No more tickets available.

I Thought this was just a grift you were doing. I didn't know it was serious now. I mean I may have to help Yeah, no, you're gonna be proud of this. Well, here's the thing that I'm gonna be most proud of is the format I have come up with a new concept of a format I came up with a theme question that people can choose to answer or not But the problem I want to solve and it could be the problem. I most want to solve it could be the problem I want to see solved a problem.

I'm thinking about people will go up in most cases and give a 10 to 20 minute Call it a Ted style talk a solo dolo talk where they kind of talk about what they're working on in their lives Then they come and sit In a chair with two besties on either side and then the four of us engage them in a conversation while we're talking We're gonna have maybe five slides that producers will put together of data points, etc So we all get educated we pull up the slide and then there'll be you know, 600 people in the auditorium 100 people in the simulcast room We will take one question from the audience or two questions if we have time with each segment And so you're gonna get a lot of bestie action but stimulated by bestie guesty positions And I think this is really what folks want now if somebody Doesn't want to give one.

Let's say Palmer just wants to talk. Well, we'll just talk with Palmer And so there's going to be an option. I told people you could your position Paper your position statement could be five minutes. It could be 20. So I want to do something on natural resource scarcity and National security so Jim latinsky the CEO of mp materials Okay, you just all you got to do is email me the person's email address or introduce me and we'll set it up So we'll we'll do something on like the supply chain of like rare earth and lithium nickel cold and so and then here's my other idea So I told everybody the problem I'd like to solve there is energy independence for America.

Perfect So then do I still need to email you now? Just email me, but here's the thing we're doing. I told everybody I just told you the Yeah, we have nick will take a note. Yeah to remind you to get the email addressed. Here's what's going to happen Okay, so you don't need me to email you I mean we don't want to guess the email if you have it and you know them I mean, I know you want to do the least amount of work, but I need to get a producers fee here I don't know.

You guys got to out vote freeberg Putting that aside I'm letting my beak. I'm fine with that too. Thank you then three because that's how all in media is working now It's just going to be votes. Well, why don't you sign the LLC agreement? Did anybody sign it yet? I was going to review it to see what fucking poison pill Freeberg put in there. Can somebody I'm not signing this shit till I have two lawyers look at all freeberg's got a poison pill in there I don't know about you guys, but I just signed any random docusigned I just assume you know, I want to get to speak You know, I'm gonna get to the conference in the last 30 days.

Yeah, so I'd like to get I'd like to get professor john mirshimer to speak He's a that'd be great. Yeah, he's a professor at the university of Chicago. He's been there 40 years. He's the leading He's a leading theorist you could say of the school of thought called realism Oh in foreign policy And he has a track record of being right about all of America's foreign policy. Oh wait just the guy you shared the video with right? Yeah, so he's the guy who talked about What do they call that the mono dual try War on order nucleosis multipolar Yeah, I mean, he has a critique he has a critique of liberal interventionism which has been the dominant Foreign policy since the end of the Cold War.

It's what got us into Iraq Afghanistan Syria Libya He predicted all those things be fiascos He also predicted that our policy of constructive engagement towards china would ultimately backfire and be a disaster And he has a very contrarian critique right now Of our policy in Ukraine that's gone viral. Yes on twitter and it's gotten like 10 million plus views He'd be an incredible person to come speak. Well, here's what's happened while we invite people, you know We invite some people they don't know the show. We knew other people and they're like, oh my god I love the show.

I'm there. What what's gonna be interesting is the next 30 days We're gonna talk to each person about what they what's topic they really want to you know double click on And then we're gonna pair people so you might have Keith reboy and Antonio You know, you might have tim urban and joe london stale or whatever And so hopefully we can find a little dynamic. Maybe people don't agree Maybe they have you know opposite positions and then we're going to then have this great socratic Dialogue with everybody and I think it's going to be a very fast pace type thing And then hopefully the speakers Sit in the VIP area And then I'm going to have a runner there with a microphone or I might do it myself So, you know, I might have Keith reboy on in the morning in the afternoon He might want to chime in on joe london stale's talk.

I run up to him with a microphone, etc So, uh, we got probably we're going to do two hours in the morning three hours in the afternoon So it's 10 to 12 so you can sleep in or come for coffee if we stay late playing poker every night It's going to be a gentle wake up 12 to 2 is a nice lunch healthy 3 to 5 nice con I'm sorry 2 to 5 3 hours of nice content Then you get a little break you go to the parties at the end of the parties You never know a poker table or two might be pulled out and we play a little cash game Who knows anything's possible.

So poker could be all three nights. I don't know, you know This depends on the degeneracy level Um, but I think it's going to be a fun time.

Okay, so uh Jake all I'm gonna introduce you to latinsky so we can Slot and if anybody had we could use a couple more female speakers people of color I'm really trying to keep it diverse and have a lot of range of speakers A lot of uh, David stands said yes early got the joe lansdale should keep Keith Roboy's they all like want to support David's team I could use a couple people maybe with the posing viewpoint So we're trying to keep it a little bit white barry.

I wanted to have barry and care of swiss or it doesn't seem like that Oil and vinegar is going to happen. Can we uh, can we get glenn greenwald? But that's right right right you're getting you're getting further and further to the right What I would like to have is somebody a matt tiebe matt tiebe. That's another kind of right guy I would like to know your definitions are all off jason these definitions don't mean anything anymore Okay, they're independent critical thinkers.

They're they originally came from the left. They're not like huge fans of unbiased capitalism But they're more on the populist side This is populist Sacks I would appreciate it particularly peter teal who's the you're the one person who can deliver it since you guys are besties Bring us peter teal the guy spoke out of god damn. All right. Give me a give me a list. I'll invite glenn. I'll invite tiebe I'll invite peter. Oh great now. We're gonna invite mere sure we have a protest outside These are the most interesting people exactly. I think the most interesting for sure.

I like mike tiebe actually. I'll give you that Here's the problem. Here's the problem Here's the problem with getting the people on the other side is that the people on the other side again It's not right versus left anymore It's sort of populist versus elitist and you already know what all the elitists are gonna say And they're too afraid to be on stage with people on the other side But I mean I think that you're Associated with peter teal with is a little bit charge and triggering for certain people that's yeah exactly that that's why they don't They don't believe them I mean they people are like how could you be friends with David? I'm like because we love each other more friends like We're besties and they're like well, but you disagree with them.

I'm like it's it's contamination by association Well, that's what they're trying to do. That's I mean David. That's what they're trying to do to me right now I'm getting the back channel. How could you do this with David sacks? And I'm like because he's my best friend That's why our pot is popular is we have four people who are friends who sometimes disagree with each other The reason you can't create the show and still any where else right? I'm not giving up my friendship with David. The reason you can't create the show anywhere else is because those people Think they get contaminated if they even have a conversation with somebody on the other side of things But you don't get that on your side Correct because we believe in free speech Because we're intellectually confident We're intellectually confident.

We don't believe in shutting down the debate right we believe in free speech The other side they're authoritarian. Yes, because they can't defend anything They just cancel people they've lost the art of persuasion I think they've given up their position would be they've given up trying to reach you You just don't get it. They've given up trying to reach you and I'm like don't give up Put up a fight if you disagree with sacks's position It's not about reaching me. It's about reaching all of them. Yes all the people out there watching They don't want to engage the debate because they can't win the debate because they don't know how to persuade All they gotta do is cancel weekly.

Look what I did to you in January 6th. All they gotta do is cancel people Yes, they're so used to cancel you every week sacks and I own you half the time. Okay, if he's good Thanks, so January 6th. We're gonna release the January 6th tapes. That's all you got. That's all you got You're like MSNBC. That's all you got We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow What you're about to be What you're about to be
