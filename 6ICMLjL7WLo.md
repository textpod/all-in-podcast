I gotta count the other another billion dollars. I lost I've lost two two billion dollars in the last two days It's recording. Please record this looks like we Looks like we need a poker game tomorrow Imagine how tilted your mouth is gonna go. Yeah He's gonna be in the markets he's gonna buy it for two million just to try and get even Hey everybody, hey everybody welcome to another episode of the all in podcast we took a week off and boy that was Sad I missed you guys. I missed my best. We should tell we should tell people we had a we had a small medical procedure for one of the besties and but everything's good and It was planned so you know nothing nothing out of the ordinary, but we just needed to take a week off That's why we missed a week and that's what we're back.

Yes, and one of the besties God I got so many jokes. I'm not gonna tell all the jokes that came into my mind right now would get you cancelled Based on the amount of money that I've lost in the last two days. I'm ready to get cancelled so it's fun I'm just gonna fucking let him rip. All right, everybody David sacks the rain man is here calling in from an undisclosed compound freeberg the Queen of Kenwa back in action and the dictator himself licking his wounds Billion a day Checking the Apple stock app hitting refresh and going thank God these companies have fundamentals Because I haven't seen this much blood since game of thrones Jason honestly at this run rate I can lose a trillion dollars Feel compared to last March when the same thing was happening, you know every day the market was down 10% Well, this is what's important to remember.

We made a joke. It was like it could only go down 10% so many days in a row March March 31st you you guys have to remember that March 31st of 2020 the headlines All over the press and you can you know go to the way back machine and look at these things, but the Dow was down 20 some odd percent the S&P was down 20% and it looked like the world was going to end and then we had our first big stimulus bill And things started to look at China started to reopen slowly and things started to look better And what's interesting is you have this rotational sort of deleveraging that's happening right now people are repricing in inflation People are moving into sort of these, you know overlooked stories getting out of growth a little bit and it's a bloodbath But I would just I would just encourage us all to remember that we were in some pretty dark days in March of last year as well And you know when you looked at it by the end of the year it looked amazing So I would just add to that the markets are looking pretty grim for tech stocks right now But this all started because of a really great jobs report showing that the economy is roaring back.

So we added 379,000 jobs in February which beat expectations by 200,000 they also revised the January gains up 166,000 So now the unemployment rate is down to 6.2% remember it was at like 15% You know last summer during the the lockdowns for COVID So I mean all of this is fundamentally due to I think really great news in the economy because COVID is ending and Which kind of begs the question of why we need another 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus bill but but I think that ultimately there's a lot of good news in the real economy and What investors are doing is figuring out how to now price or reprice All these different stocks in light of the economy roaring back So just a little just a little math lesson to build on what you're saying, you know, everybody has a risk free rate and All stocks are priced according to that risk free rate And when you know for the many for the last sort of year particularly when risk free rates were essentially zero to negative Meaning, you know, that's that's the riskless money where you that you get from the government It was hard to do anything except belong growth stocks in a big big way But David to your point if we get two or three more quarters of these kinds of jobs numbers you're gonna have a you know low single digit unemployment number and what that means is wages will have to go up for businesses to compete and That's the kind of traditional form of inflation That actually reprices things because you then you lever up rates to kind of control inflation When you lever up rates and you can you know, all of a sudden they're not zero, but they're two three four five six percent This is sort of what brought the tech bubble to a halt in 2000 Which is that you know, you had six percent real rates And so you can't own businesses that are projecting revenues let alone profits in 2026 When you can invest your money in a bond and make six percent six percent and that's what I like So just for folks that don't know this week started with this big bond sell off And what that means is bonds that used to yield zero percent when you sell them.

They're now yielding Ten year treasuries I think are at one and a half points, right? And so as an investor if I can make one and a half percent with no risk by owning US treasuries over the next ten years That may feel like a better bet than owning some risky asset some speculative company now The other thing that that it has done and Chumath correct me if I'm off on this But what I'm hearing is that that higher rate because bonds sold down because people are expecting inflation to come back up The interest rates to borrow money are going up And so if you're a hedge fund or an institutional money manager over the last year or so you've been able to borrow money for zero percent You can lever up your portfolio and and and buy as many stocks as you want without paying any interest on it And now that rates are creeping back up people are delevering They're they're taking risk off and that's causing a sell off in both bonds and stocks and especially on the speculative end of the market where you know there's been Obviously unchecked kind of investment capital.

No, you're you're you're you're absolutely right like look at the at the end of the day The cost of borrowing for a company goes up. What that's really saying is the investor that's lending them the money You know has other alternatives And so then they're willing to charge you more and more for this for this capital and as that happens you'll see some companies get into potentially some real trouble because you know they're gonna be borrowing money at rates where they can't necessarily generate the cash flows in the future to pay those things back at the same time as you said if you look at sort of like, you know, the SPAC market has taken a real beating What are what are SPACs really? Well, you know in many ways SPACs are synthetic bonds Right and the reason is because you know if you go and boy if you go and buy a SPAC one share of any SPAC You have the ability to redeem that if you don't like the deal that it does and get back your coupon So, you know, you're notional rather.

So if you were to buy a government, you know, German bond at negative 1% Or buy any SPAC where you can put that same, you know, $10 to work and get back $10. Well, you do that versus getting back $9.90 So in many ways like, you know, the SPAC market benefited from rates at zero because you could synthetically be long enough to get back to synthetically belong SPACs as almost a way of being synthetically long fixed income Now, as rates go up, that's not true. So what that leaves in the SPAC market are actually people who want to own long term equity And if you combine that with what we just said, which is the cost of capital going up and the discount rate going up Now all of a sudden companies need to be really real and you're seeing that because if you look at the companies that have just announced SPAC deals just in the last few days Their stocks have gotten absolutely obliterated and they're right on the knife's edge going into the redemption period So if you have one or two more months of this where all of a sudden bonds look better And you know, some of these SPACs post announcement, but pre de spacking go through, you know, 10 bucks a share people just redeem for $10 And you'll have a you'll have a bunch of busted IPOs or by the way, by the way, another thing we're seeing sorry Jason But another thing I think we're seeing right now is in the near term is a feedback loop.

So as selling takes place What happens is market participants are jumping in and short selling and participating in the trend of that stock And so there are these these kind of experiences that are underway where it's not just about a sell off of owners But it's also about a momentum trade that a lot of people are playing into and so there is a very short term extremely compounded effect of The de levering that's happening and the cycling that's happening in these markets. All right, so it's super volatile and probably will be for a little bit of Time here, right? I think so.

I think we need to figure out whether there's really Whether there's a real inflation Risk dragon cooking someplace if there if there really is inflation like again you have to think like the trillions of dollars we put into the economy eventually has to come out in productive goods and services and And all of that excess capital will probably inflate prices Now it begs a different question Which is we maybe we've just actually been missing inflation all along because if you ask somebody who lives in a city You know what the cost of rent has been that that thing has been inflating by feels like 20% a year for years So and you know and education costs and healthcare So maybe we've just done a really terrible job in the last few years of actually measuring inflation the way it should be You know it's calling this whole basket of you know, you know, CPI X energy like I mean It's kind of nutty.

Maybe the whole thing just made no sense a few years ago I look to David's point and David gave me just a huge bag of red pills while we were off this week So I've been just I've been on a bender on these red pills But if you look at those three categories, what do they have in common? education healthcare and housing massive regulation and then if you look at the things that have gone down consumer goods electronics Food etc or have stayed flat in terms of inflation Those are things that the free market participates the government is not involved and it's not just the fact There's a lot of government Regulation in things like healthcare and education.

It's also that the government pays for a significant portion of it And so there's no reason for the people, you know, who are building the government to keep costs down I mean, this is why the price of education of a college degree keeps going up is because the government's paying for a lot of it I say I David you probably I think you you may have seen this but when you know when we announced our Merger with Clover for IPOC one of the first slides I put up there was the only place in the market Since 2010 where you would have made more money Then being long Facebook and Google and Apple and Amazon was being long united healthcare SIGNA wellspring and the reason is because healthcare was this incredible thing post Obamacare and nobody wants to talk about it On the left because it makes it look terrible but we created massive price inflation and United healthcare was a 30 billion dollar company now right in violation be careful right before right before Obamacare passed today It's a 330 billion dollar company and the level of growth that they and etna and you know SIGNA and wellspring these come these companies have seen is astounding so these highly regulated You know systems of societal infrastructure.

Oh, that's where all the gains of it regulatory capture writ large Right. Well soon as the government is paying for it all the suppliers know they can increase their prices Why wouldn't they so it's what happens is the government tries to make something free for people and all they end up doing is making it really expensive Well, they make it they make it a day ago and now they make it they make it expensive in this very in this very convoluted way, which is hard to track right because it's like, you know Who's actually paying well, you know the insurance companies want to just book more revenue Even if they're you know, even if they're gross aggregate profit grows much much more slowly They'd rather make the same amount of profit on a billion dollars versus a hundred million dollars So what do they do their incentive is to just jack prices up who are paying those prices Companies pay those prices who bears those costs all of this stuff is really not clear because ultimately downstream Somebody has to pay for this stuff taxpayers and it's all obscura fight.

I mean look I mean look at the tent story that we were sharing on our group group thread $61,000 for San Francisco to put people into tents with a no big contract one question I have for for yall is We look back the last time we were at 6% unemployment July 2014 we look at the unemployment graph It's spiked up to as we discussed 15% and it has plummeted back down now to the 6% rate if we look back on this moment in time and how quickly the Economy is recovering from this disaster that we've never experienced before it looks like this recession is Is going to be recovered and we're gonna we're already back in business in such a short period of time compared to What happened in the Great Recession and the dotcom boom? So is America and the US dollar and the economy Anti fragile now to use a telepterm What how do we look at what happened with the economy? Did Trump do everything right with the stimulus? This is a this is a complete outlier in the following way in a typical recession What what has to happen is so you have a contraction in the economy? But you don't know when the bottom is right the bottom is some number of months in the future and Government policy is basically trying to create a soft landing Where all of a sudden the cost of capital is low enough now where people say up on the margin now this incremental dollar I would rather borrow and invest which drives growth which can then get the economy growing going and so you know How does a government deal with that they are looking at economic data and saying okay? You know what let me cut rates I'll cut rates again.

I'll cut rates again And that's really the one tool that they have in their toolbox because they're trying to predict in the future How many rate cuts do I need to get or have rather how big do they need to be? Until I get to that place where you bottom out the pandemic was the exact opposite because in many ways We actually hit the bottom in month one because we said everything go to zero right now right when you shut everything down You technically can't have less economic Activity and zero yeah, and so and so in many ways you price the bottom on day one boom and in hindsight You know the the real Insight would have been to see that and say I'm buying this moment because it only gets better from here so in in one ways like all of the tools are Actually now we need to think about them in opposite and I don't think we have That training to do that well so we're still going back to the same toolbox Which is why what David said is so true, you know, we're thinking about incremental stimulus as As a as like a way to get to a soft landing But we've already actually taken the hard medicine a year ago Let's let's tackle that sacks should we and let's let's take virtue signaling and populism out of this discussion just on an economic basis Is it necessary to send every American another? 600,000 2000 knowing what we know today with the unemployment rate going down or would be redder We'd be better off taking that capital and deploying it in education Unemployment or something else well first of all it's 1.9

trillion that we don't have we're borrowing it I mean I would extend unemployment for people in those hard hit sectors haven't come back yet but most this money is going for blue state bailouts of Cities that are totally mismanaged This is not going to help states like California or several or cities like San Francisco get their house in order because this is going to bail them out and defer that day of Reckoning from their chronic mismanagement. So we're borrowing money We don't have to bail out people cities and states that don't really deserve it I do think we should help the people who've been impacted but But it doesn't require two trillion and look here's the thing we're already down to six percent of employment We're gonna be down to I'd say probably three or four percent in two quarters I mean the economy is coming roaring back and the reason it's coming roaring back is because COVID is ending right so the biggest announcement Recently and I think this is playing into what's happening in the stock market as well is that Biden? Announced that every American who's over the age of 16 who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by the end of May by end of May I mean we're gonna have Yeah, right well he was Just yeah when he came in office in January he's saying the worst is not over a lot I mean that was clearly sandbagging the worst was over and We're gonna have 300 million doses by end of May and the only reason why everybody won't be able to get one is because of States that are you know creating these ridiculous hoops to get through confiscating them Yeah, exactly like California right now is has three million doses sitting on a shelf because of all the crazy hoops that Gavin Newsom has everyone going through because he wants to score Browning points on equity, right? So if the government would just get out of the way let everyone who wants to get a vaccine get one without worrying about Making sure the exact right person in the exact right line gets one first this thing will be over by Memorial Day over now Look, there'll still be a case here or there for sure.

They'll be I'm not saying they'll be zero case of COVID But there'll be zero pandemic understood as such by the way, I'll also say one other You know important point about the stimulus One that that sacks made yesterday the CBO put out a projection This is the the budget office at the Congress and they said that the US national debt is likely to reach 202% of GDP by 2051 so the amount of debt that the US government will own Is 2x the amount of all the revenue generated by all of the industries in the US? Oh in about 30 years, that's an insane statistic and the reason that people look at you know GDP or debt to GDP is because you have to pay your debt down at some points You owe some interest on that debt you have to pay it down and every year you have to generate revenue to pay the bondholders and though how do you how does the federal government generate revenue to either issues more debt or taxes and In order to meet a 202% level of debt relative to GDP you end up raising taxes so significantly as a percent of GDP to cover the The the interest payments and the principal payments every year that you end up stalling out the economy cutting important services Etc.

And so we're in a circumstance now where the the benefit we're going to get from taking on this additional debt relative to economic growth and stimulus Doesn't actually outweigh the cost of that debt and we're facing a fiscal crunch at some point in the next decade or two And there is this flood this big question mark outstanding right now on a global stage Is the dollar really the safest place to be it does everyone really want to be dollar denominated? If this is the circumstance that the US federal government is going to be facing Here's a question for Chamath that I'm curious about if the government is buying all this debt Shouldn't they be buying some amount of equity as well so they can profit from the government's issuing debt Jason? No, I know but isn't the government also going into the market and buying up corporate debt through all of this Shouldn't they have profits coming from that? So there there was a risk last year where you know corporates may not have been able to fund their obligations And so the government basically said we're going to be the buyer of the last resort and step in and it's effectively what they did was they They they essentially froze the credit markets because if you were going to then bet on some of these companies not being able to raise capital You would have gone to the worst part of the you know the stack or you would have bet actually that there was going to be the state transition So meaning debt is very tightly scripted as you know triple a plus, you know double a a minus and These transitions from these tiers of like investment grade to junk to whatever are huge events and Basically the government said no Everybody take your chips and go home because we are going to backstop Companies like Ford or whoever folks that were teetering and so they effectively said this is going to be you know until I tell you Otherwise a rigged game.

I'm going to make sure I backstop these things these companies will always be able to have money So my question though Chamath is if the government is going to do that and take that risk Shouldn't they get some warrants or some upside in the company's future success to then create a virtuous cycle here that if they Did backstop it maybe they had warrants for five percent of the company Like you would give if you were doing a debt instrument, they could probably do it if they were a direct lender and they had that chance And they didn't really do it in 2008 when they did it I mean, maybe they could have done it in a better way here when you enter the open market There's no such contract and so you can't negotiate that look I I want to sort of talk about something slightly related to this which is If you actually looked at that 1.9

trillion dollar stimulus bill the thing that makes the most sense And I think nobody would complain about was saying let's give a means based test Where the poorest Americans get the most money call it five or six thousand and the richest Americans get nothing And I think nobody would disagree with that and if you added up all of that money It's probably on the order of 500 or 700 billion dollars if you did it if you did a really expensive package And and I think people would I mean all of us would raise our hands and say we shouldn't get a fucking dime And you know people other people should be getting many multiples of 1400 Why should anybody who wasn't impacted sacks get anything like if you are not impacted? Yeah, of course lose your job We're staying home.

You're not spending money. Why should you get anything? Because I think that's all the money going into NFTs and Making bets on GameStop and doing all this of course, you know shenanigans with Bitcoin Of course look this is Rahm Emanuel 2.0 remember Rahm Emanuel back in the 2008 2009 financial crisis said never let a crisis go to waste this is now never let a crisis reach its end Right, they don't want it to be over because this crisis. That's a good segue Okay, so yeah, this crisis is the justification for this piggy bank of spending that this this wish list They wanted to pass for a long time very little of it actually has to do with helping the very little very little In fact, if you actually look at the breakdown of this 1.9

trillion dollar bill It's every typical bill. It has a better title, but ultimately it's a bunch of pork barrels By the way, there's a bunch of insanity in there like COVID testing I mean guess what we don't need to test anyone for COVID in about 30 to 60 days. We need the $1 billion dollars We could say you know and the list goes on but I think the point is What sacks is making is totally true We're continuing to latch on to the COVID pandemic crisis as a means to an end And we're not really solving any problems that are outstanding as the COVID pandemic and the risks remember Let's just go back a year if you guys remember the reason we shut down the economy was to flatten the curve There was no assumption.

We were gonna end COVID The idea was let's make sure that the health care system doesn't get overwhelmed with people dying I see handle as many people in ICU beds and now we're in a situation where we're saying you still can't go outside ICU beds are largely open. You still have to do X and Y and Z We still need to be testing everyone and all of those risks and considerations should be coming off the table as more people have had COVID and more people have gotten vaccinated and instead we're using the fear that's been embedded in us over the past year as a mechanism to drive spending in a way that is clearly economically unsustainable ultimately counterproductive and Unfortunately is being you know used as a mechanism for keeping folks in office and paying back their friends and all this other sort of nonsense It's freeberg.

You had a you had a breakdown of it by the way, because it's not just the the federal stimulus bill You know the the California breakdown of what they spent saying do you have that? Do you have that? Can you fill it out? What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send the link because it was through a FOIA request They were forced to list it so California that had an emergency declaration joke a total fucking joke I'm gonna do that emergency declaration It gave the governor the power and the ability to enter into no bid contracts to meet the the demands of the quote unquote emergency And the contracts that were entered into are all publicly listed and available in a link that I will share with you guys And it'll be available online I don't think a reporter has done what needs to be done Which is to go through those contracts and identify how much money was spent on what and where that and why that money was spent And who ended up benefiting from it some of these contracts including for example 1.9

billion dollars to Perkin Elmer to provide nasal swabs and other you know reactive chemistry needed to run COVID tests with an Overflow capacity of their lab of 4,000 tests a day, which by the way costs a few thousand dollars For 1.9 billion dollars and ultimately California didn't really do any of the testing it was done by private labs Where did that 1.9 billion dollars go? There was another amount of money There was a hundred million dollars spent on Accenture to build the vaccination website no bid contract hundred million dollars for Website in a weekend there was the carbon health guy did there was another Separately for his own vaccination program that he was running which you know obviously highlights just how inept this whole process is there was another Incredible multi hundred million dollar contract entered into for a guy and then I looked up his address on Google Maps And I looked at his home in his office It's in like a strip mall next to a donut shop and this guy is the guy he's a he's technically a doctor But not really a practicing doctor who would who got paid hundreds of millions of dollars to source overflow? hospital and doctor capacity for prisons in the in California in Sane the shit that's in there and so you know the the the total kind of I think mismanagement of capital and Obviously inability to kind of manage crisis Yeah By the way, I think the covets the fiscal the federal covert stimulus looks very similar in terms of the pork and other nonsense That's going on in there makes yeah Hey mainstream media instead of fucking grinding me about what you know a couple hundred million dollars of share sales so that I can Allocate it to fucking climate change.

Why don't you do your goddamn job and fucking tell this story? Yeah, no cuz this would take water. Don't get your signaling points. Oh, Joe. I'll post the link now It more I need more red pills. What a joke get me those red pills from Miami So there's one there's one article like you're right Jamath like they there's so many scandals By the way, there was one just reported in the San Francisco Chronicle about how the city of San Francisco paid $16 million to To pay for something like 260 tents or something like that tents tents homeless people It was Burning man $61,000 per tent you can build an ad you for that guys I have an entire gaggle of reporters sweating every single fucking Share that I buy or sell and you know, no, I don't this is fucking stupid And and and there's true.

There's trillions of dollars just swashing around like what? Third world fucking banana Republic Kinda go ahead fact San Francisco is that all this money all this money all this money was dished out according to no bid Contract so so basically it was not a competitive bidding process because it was a covert emergency and so yeah look I mean all of Newsom's big backers in the healthcare industry got these giant no bid contracts these you know the homeless industrial complex service providers in San Francisco got these giant contracts none of it was bid out And the politicians would love to be able to keep this going because they've never had more power They've never had more degrees of freedom to reward their political supporters So, you know, I think there was one really good article.

I just want to bring up here That was by Jonathan Chate. Oh, this is the Intelli John seer in the New Yorker. Yeah, the New York New York New York, so yeah, his articles called zero COVID risk is the wrong standard and he defines a term called Zeroism what what Chate writes is he describes zeroism as the following he says Zeroism is an inability to conceive of public health measures in cost benefit terms the pandemic becomes an enemy That must be destroyed at all costs and any compromise could lead to death and is therefore unacceptable So in other words if like one person might die then we need to continue all these emergency measures It's and and this is the thing is that look COVID as a pandemic is going to be over by June Okay, but there will always be cases of COVID it's gonna return as a seasonal illness and the question is are we going to allow? Zeroism to be the policy every year We basically give these politicians unlimited power to do lockdown shutdowns no big contracts and on and on and on You already see with the teachers unions, right? The education unions are refusing to go back to work Even after their members are vaccinated Yeah, saying that there must be 14 days of no meaning zero communities spread before they can safely return So the teachers unions or the education users saying is we're not gonna go back to work We want paid vacation until there's zero cases.

Can I just say this is not realistic? I mean I I Went to get My daughter's passport updated at USPS They're working while I was driving there. I saw all kinds of infrastructure. It was happening We pay into a system that's supposed to guarantee in return Some level of commitment by individuals that buy into that same system teachers are part of that Yes, you can't you can't have a get out of jail free card whenever you want to just say no We're gonna change the rules and it but it applies to everybody else The firefighters have to show up the cops have to show up the ambulance people have to show up the nurses show up You know the USP drivers Bart everybody shows up going to work But these people fucking teachers the teachers should Parents should take their kids out of school.

That's what they should do and then do what Jason How how how are most people you basically? Well, if you got five or six parents together and they don't have time for that shit Who are you talking about? My sentence six parents get together and if they had if they had what do you call it when you give parents a little bit of money for school? Fouter voucher systems the voucher system would then create the competition if six or seven families could get five ten k Each and then run their own little bubble school their micro school.

This could actually put pressure Well, it's not gonna it's not gonna happen But you actually have a pretty good point what what Newsom should do is he should go to these unions and say listen if you're not gonna go back And you're not gonna teach no problem We're gonna take the money that we give to your schools and give them out as vouchers and let the parents do what they want in other words We're gonna break your union that is what he needs to do time to break the new some news The problem with Newsom is that his biggest contributor? Single biggest contributor is the education union, right? And so look he has publicly said that yes I'm in favor of schools reopening but it's not enough for you to espouse the opinion that schools should go back I mean you're the governor you need to go make that happen you need to go tell the teachers unions You must go back right now because there is no incremental COVID risk to the teachers They've seen this now that states which have open schools have not seen an increase in COVID There is no science to support this he needs to tell him go back right now or we're gonna break your union He will not do that because he's an employee of those unions and by the way I have an update I have an update on the on the recall if you guys want it No, wait, let's let's get to it in one second because I do want to I do want to just say well first off I want to make an observation that we are turning into the rational Rush Limbaugh.

We're all kind of yelling Violin or Creep Kind of a little bit silly But I am just observing the tone here a little bit I will say like if you guys remember we talked about this like last year Which is you know, what will life be like post COVID post the pandemic and if you guys remember I said this and I still firmly believe in I think we're now seeing it play out Which is that the fear that gets created by the actual crisis will persist in terms of this the subconscious Behavior of the population for a long period of time.

That's what happened after 9 11 You know the insanity that went on with the TSA and security checking and Racism against brown people and everything that arose post 9 11 Persisted for a very long time as a result of the shock that we all experienced and I don't think people were very cognizant of it occurring It was just like oh well This is now the normal way of life Everyone is so fearful of catching COVID and they've been so kind of trained and told that they're gonna die from COVID that we're finding ourselves in a Circumstance where anything can then be rationalized and those of folks that then have power and the ability can magnify the circumstances into something that it seems kind of shocking and absurd if you put on kind of a rational hat But this is just one manifestation of what I think will be the case we were Um, we all know people that have been vaccinated that are more than two weeks since their second shot of vaccination Who are still scared of doing things like being around other people or going into grocery stores? Because quote unquote there may be a chance that there may be a variant that may not work on the vaccine that I may get that may end up killing me And if you actually do the math on it and you think about it rationally You're not gonna get COVID and you're not gonna die, but there's a chance therefore I'm gonna change my behavior and that's part of what I think we're seeing Manifest at a very large scale is this like trained fear mind that we all have at this point and policy and everything and by the yeah No, I'm not gonna $1.9

trillion stimulus is in part kind of empowered by this fear Well, I I Disagree slightly so look is there gonna be some PTSD from COVID? Yeah, I'm sure there will be but I think people are ready to to get out and With a vengeance and I think people want to and the problem is Is not that people are afraid but that the people doing the health establishment doing the messaging is not out there telling us the right things I mean, you've got Fauci out there telling people that even after the vaccinated They cannot take off their masks until 2022 that they're not gonna be able to die.

No seriously They're not gonna be able to dine indoors. They can't go to a movie a concert or a sporting event And they can't socialize indoors except with other also vaccinated people. This is what Fauci is saying I mean, so no wonder you've got so many people out there saying that they're gonna wait and see whether the vaccine works or not Well, because effectively Fauci in the health establishment. They're being so cautious in their guidance. They're effectively giving anti Vax messaging. They're basically saying that the vaccines don't work very well, which is just stupid I mean, what they all be going out saying nobody has died who has been gotten a shot Nobody has gone to the ICU who's gotten Nobody's been on a ventilator who's been Vaccinated am I correct with those three statements? Yes.

Yes, they need to say if you know that's no ICU No ventilator. Yes, we have the shot What we need to be saying is very simple, which is if you've been vaccinated You will not die if you've been vaccinated You will not die put that on a billboard and everyone's gonna want to get vaccinated, you know only 55% of the population right now Says that they're gonna get vaccinated as soon as they can I'm ordering a billboard right now from the besties I think that just says if you're vaccinated, you won't die the besties. I think it's pretty reasonable that Individuals would still be afraid, you know, because I think we learned over the last year that we can't trust The institutions that are supposed to tell us in an objective way meaning you can't trust the WHO you can't trust an IH You can't trust the CDC you can't necessarily trust the Surgeon General.

You couldn't trust the president Very complicated, right? So I think it's reasonable that people are skeptical What I think is unreasonable is when you know sort of like organized Unions or organizations or corporations who have a responsibility to run the infrastructure of this country basically say It all these rules apply to everybody else but me That's where I think we have to really just kind of question ourselves and fix that that's not cool. It's just fundamentally not reasonable So we have Biden saying that everyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by end of May We have Gavin Newsom saying that most of the state but not all of it will reopen in August Well, wait a second, you know May June July August.

Why is there like a three month gap here? It's because of the zeroism. I mean, I think Newsom has embraced the zeroism if not zeroism What's the number we have 8,000 people die a day in America? on average historically as soon as everyone if it's under 500 That's a day should we be going back? That's not even the question. That's not even the question once everyone can get a vaccine It's over if you choose not to get the vaccine like sorry. It's on you. We're moving on It's like we're gonna ask it Can I ask the question? By the way the equivalent of zeroism would be no one's allowed to drive a car because people dying dying cars all The cars have to be 35 miles an hour or they or you or yeah Or no one's allowed to drink alcohol because alcohol has some adverse effect or increases chance of cancer or whatever or whatever It's a point like do you end up you just triggered chamomile? Nice Bordeaux and burgundy doesn't give you cancer now I don't know what the wine budget post apocalypse I mean, it's gonna take a lot of it's gonna take a lot of more billions before I stop drinking my wine Question I want to throw this into the scrum What do you guys think about? I mean also we're all just so punchy because we didn't talk last week We're all so excited All of our wives have been telling us what to do we had nobody to vent with and now we're just going crazy It's like we've been in a two week time out bikes and go for a bike ride No, no guys, honestly, honestly like have you guys like I have not gotten a word in edge wise with Matt for two weeks And I was so looking forward to talking to you guys.

I'm like I want to talk No, but listen no guys. What do you guys think about the? The the the biological Patriot Act thing, you know, there's these vaccination passports that people are talking about I just want to get a sense of where you guys think this is going and This is the slippery slope that I think ends all slippery slopes with respect to privacy, right? So I think it was proposed in the EU that you would need to get a you know A digitally verified kind of passport stamp that shows that you have been vaccinated in order to travel freely amongst other EU nations And so if you think about the implications of this now the government or governments have the ability To demand that in order for you to move around freely You need to represent something digitally or represent something about some health care procedure that you may or may not want to kind of You know take on so that sound everyone kind of nods their head and says that seems totally reasonable and rational It's COVID.

We're all at risk. We should protect ourselves I want to yada yada, but where does this go next right because then it becomes well Have you had your measles vaccine or you know? Hey, you know Do you have herpes and therefore you can't you have to show someone your herpes passport if you want to have sex with them or you know? End up kind of going to a point where we really don't have a barrier between what's private and what's nationalized Or even super nationalized in the context of the EU And you know, is there kind of a slippery slope that emerges by allowing this amount of invasiveness of personal Decision making and personal data and making it available to government agencies in order to have access to the liberties that you you know Believe may be endowed to you as an individual citizen of the world or what do you do? What do we do? Well, I just think proposals like this are I think they're gonna fade away very quickly Once COVID is over and and the real issue we have right now Is that not enough the population wants to get vaccinated because again? The health authorities are being much too conservative in their guidance.

So, you know, there's some polling numbers on this that So only 15% of the public are actually opposed to getting the vaccine like you kind of call them anti vax but there's another 20 to 30 percent that are taking this wait and see approach and You know, they're gonna make sure that like other people go first and don't sprout tails or antlers or something before You know, they're gonna be willing to get it But but the reason why they're all waiting and seeing is because you've got you know Fauci and others saying that we're not gonna have normalcy until Christmas or maybe even 2022 So if if that's the case if things aren't gonna be normal till next year Why wouldn't you wait, you know? And I think what we need to be saying is look go get the vaccine where everyone who wants it's gonna get it in the next Two months and COVID is over.

It's over guys But sacks if there is a digital passport requirement in the EU, where do you think that goes? Like if you have to show proof of a vaccination order to enter the EU without quarantine Yeah, it's it's it's it's not a great precedent, but I but I I don't know that it's gonna be necessary Because I just think that COVID is gonna end there is a self quickly It's it's a this I like sacks's point of view Which is if you decide you're not gonna do this then you've put yourself at risk But if nobody else can die from it, why do we need to check it? I understand like maybe in this bridge period Spring to summer if you go to a Warriors game or a Knicks game where you want to go to Burning Man or the EDC You know electronic Daisy Carnival, whatever Freeburg goes to you know When he goes to his raves, I mean free burger got a rave is kind of the video we need to see I think but Why would that's fine with me in the short term? But in the long term, I don't want to give them that power Look what happened with the Patriot Act and then them monitoring our data forever and the government being able to put You know what Snowden found out like they were able to put on the AT&T back bone the ability to sniff all data I mean it's overreaching last January or February I think Jason it was one of our first pods where I kind of put this marker out there on this biological Patriot Act And I said it's coming.

I'm gonna put another marker out there By the way, cuz like you know, there may be something like this in New York. I think most cities will have to have them I think places Jason exactly as you say for sporting events for concerts. It'll be very hard As a number of strains increase as the severity ebbs and flows over time For us to not end up in this place and I think it will be because certain people will feel a paternalistic Desire to sort of you know, it'll come from a good place like I want to help everybody But they'll pass a law and that law will just get perturbed and and it'll create all kinds of crazy Consequences, but I want to put another shit out there Which is you know, there was a really important civil rights case called masterpiece cake shop versus Colorado civil rights commission It went to the Supreme Court and it was basically a guy who owned a Bakery and he refused I think it was to make a cake for a same sex couple And ultimately, you know, the decision was yeah, he's allowed the Supreme Court gave a very narrow ruling that he was allowed to withhold service and I asked this question, which is well, what is the difference? Frankly between withholding service from a same sex couple or withholding service from somebody that isn't vaccinated Because you know in the eyes of the business person, you know, assuming apparently you're allowed to make these kinds of you know judgments Because you're a private business the implications I think are really vast and so I'm just gonna put it out there that I think that It's actually David.

I'll take the other side So I think that there's going to be these biological Patriot acts unfortunately And then the second thing that I'll say is that I do think that it will get litigated to the Supreme Court and I think that narrowly What will come down is that businesses will be able to decide and I think this is actually what will put the vaccination or anti vaccination movement To the forefront because I think in this complex global world where We don't know where diseases come from Except we know that they are more communicable. They can be more deadly and they're more pervasive and they spread faster just because of the nature in which the world is set up There's gonna there's probably going to be less and less tolerance for anti vaccination.

Now that may slow down The actual process of getting vaccines to market Because we'll want to make it even safer if we're going to do forced vaccinations of certain things but I'm just going to put a put a check out there that I don't know I don't know that we need to force people to get vaccinated But I think that we need to recognize that once people have the option of getting vaccinated. There's no need to Have the same public policy response, right? So so look if Biden's correct that we're gonna have 300 million doses by end of May And I think he must be correct because he's been very conservative in his guidance Then we should declare a date certain for the end of COVID.

I'm not saying that the virus won't exist I'm not saying there won't be a smattering of cases I'm saying from a public policy perspective. There's no longer a panic a raging pandemic to justify these incredible new powers That the government has asserted, right? What would you do that? The number of shots in arms or the number of deaths per day? No, it's look once Once everyone can get the vaccine and then I think that's so availability So I mean look what we should and it will be available as long as You know governors like Newsom get out of the way and stop restricting the administration of it But I think we need to declare a date certain where we say listen on June 1st There is no more justification for government having these extraordinary powers to lock us down to require us I don't think we even need to wear masks beyond June 1st.

And by the way, I was pro mask I was in favor of a mask mandate a year ago as you guys know, but there's no need for it after June 1st There's no need to have these Crazy not if you're back and you'd write freeberg like I mean you you want to get vaccinated Right freeberg like I mean you wouldn't matter. I I I it doesn't matter. I just um, you know I think it's it's a good point that sex is making it's easy for people to say let's wear a mask and protect ourselves but If you don't care about wearing a mask, but there are plenty of people who do and I think the question is at what point Do we allow liberty to kind of play a role here? And it's it's not just about, you know, what one person's point of view, which by the way turned out to be wrong multiple times over the last year Is in terms of what they think that other people should do and you know, what what does it mean to actually have freedom of choice and liberty? I mean, it's a really fundamental question.

Yeah, I mean if you look at states that that is a key We have Texas has opened up and said no mask mandate One of the things that hurt us in this was we didn't have a centralized Government dictating everything and now we see like hey, maybe Maybe having states make individuals. I don't know if that's necessarily true. I'll say something about this that I think is important It may be true that masks stop community spread of the virus But it doesn't necessarily mean that we stopped the spread of the virus The virus still spread we still had a lot of viral cases in the united states We had a lot of deaths that arose and whatever restrictions we put in place people still made the choice to go into other people's homes Take their mask off Enjoy free air enjoy drinks and give each other the virus and that's where so much of the spread occurred I think you guys are not Confronting this really obvious thing.

I think like this masterpiece cake shop thing is a really important concept like what happens I'm just going to use an extreme example If it goes to the Supreme Court, you mean? No, let's just say that you know, google's engineers unionize and they decide that you know They want everybody else at google to be vaccinated And then google says yeah, you're right If you want to work at google you need to be vaccinated not just private company private company not just for coveted It's a private company not just for coveted. By the way, that is a rule at schools, right? I mean, I think my my uh My preschool or my kid goes here in san francisco requires that's proof of vaccination for the kids in order for them to go to school Traveling seems to be different and see traveling in some places is on wait Just public infrastructure some on private infrastructure.

I know but just just just focus on this issue What happens if private organizations pass a decision? Yeah, that you have to be vaccinated it'll go to the supreme court and if you look at masterpiece They they'll win they will be they will they will come out with the right to say that Which is fine You can go work somewhere else. Why is that why is that a problem exactly? Yeah, I'm just curious I'm just curious how this plays out if if only half the population of america Well, maybe they'll lose good engineers and the free market will resolve itself where google will end up saying You know what? We're not going to pass this mandate because all the good engineers are going to leave So let's just leave it.

You know leave it be I'm I'm more worried about the politicians The government yeah the government trying to hold on to the power That it's asserted over us over the past year even after covid so long that's right I don't want them having a database of my medical records. No, right? And so this is why look, I think we need to declare a date servant certain that Covid as a pandemic is over my date is memorial day It's very clear to me that once everyone has the vaccine it's over just look. I think this is This is when yeah, this is what so I actually think that the nuisance recall which will be in Will be going on this summer Uh, this is what that election is going to turn into in my opinion is so so by the way quick Can I give a quick update on yes, please? Okay, so I talked to the recall people this morning.

They're up to 1.95 million Signatures, he's done. So 50 000 votes short of 2 million They will be at or over 2 million in two weeks, which is the end of the signature period Their validation rate is about 84 percent. So I think this is clearly going to pass There will be a recall election. It will be around august now fast forward Newsome has said the state won't reopen until august But I think that by may june july you will see just about every other state reopen Obviously, texas already completely reopened But even blue states like connecticut have now lifted lockdowns.

They still have a mass mandate for the time being But I think what you could see by this summer is that california will look like a laggard You'll see that politicians like newson are holding on to this zeroist philosophy. They're being too restrictive They look ridiculous compared to other states and he still probably won't have an agreement with the teachers unions to go back to school And uh, I think this could become the big issue in the in the recall you want to make an announcement sacks You want to make an announcement now? We have a special announcement Tumac might be taking a you know, tumac might be taking a hiatus from work given where the markets are I thought you know, I thought this governor thing would be value destructive.

It looks like actually I would have saved money Fuck it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it again. I'm back in I'm back in position. Oh my gosh, I don't need to be cynical, but if you I am losing so much money. Wow in your state sacks They can't collect signatures at the supermarket or at restaurants or disneyland So maybe maybe new some shut everything down so that you can collect sags Well, it's interesting because they actually found that direct mail was a very effective way of getting signatures So they've gotten around that but so Gavin Newsom is cutting the budget of the US postal service No, look Newsom is definitely there's going to be a recall election I think it'll be around august and now there's a recall efforts underway for uh, chesa budin The killer da the killer da of san francisco Oh As well as gas going in la and the san francisco school board, but we got to talk You know, we got to talk about how budin responded to our last pod, right? I Lord David I have three comments to say before we talk about budi number one.

I've never seen you more energetic Did you get The red you guys, man. Did you did you get a me? Did you download a fourth emotion? Did you download a fourth emotion in palm beach? He's been at the massage parlor every morning? Oh, it's feeling it. You're right. It's like a build up over the last two weeks. It's like a you know, uh, yeah Big release too much too much energy. I mean how how little have you spoken in the last two weeks? Has jackwin spoken the entire I know what that feels like I need the bestie therapy.

I didn't realize I needed this Jake alfreeper you guys you don't know this but saxie and I called each other on friday and we spoke for half an hour and like I We were so lonely he did he actually conference called all four of us I picked up and we spoke for half an hour It felt like a mini pod. It was so wonderful. Oh my god You know what men are too proud to uh men are too proud to go to therapy. So they start podcast I was telling a friend of mine I was telling I was telling a friend like this podcast was kind of one of the surprising joys of my life over the last year It really felt like a great kind of second.

You got the joy. Oh, I had your joy. We did have to download a joy Yeah, I have no knowledge joy now Okay, he's there but it's smiling. Wow. It's incredible. Okay, sax go tell us about booty. Yeah, tell us about it Yeah, let me find the the tweet. So basically, you know, remember in the last five weeks ago We chaser was supposed to be on our pod. He canceled and so then in response to that Jason hold the chicken noises for a couple of minutes here. Hold on So I responded to chase us saying listen, you don't have to come on our pod, but I'll challenge you to debate Let's do a debate whatever format you want and we posted it on on twitter So he didn't respond but it by the way it got like 180,000 views So a lot of people watched the challenge and so but the crazy thing is instead of responding directly Chesa had a high school friend and campaign worker Post a blog responding to me which and Jason got mentioned too, but it was crazy.

It was like, why don't you just respond directly? anyway, he had this this shill respond and what he basically said was in this response was he cited all these charging statistics and he tried to claim that chase has charged just as many cases as the previous da The problem with that is charging doesn't really mean anything because you can charge someone and then plead the charges down From a felony to a misdemeanor. It doesn't mean that the person was actually punished. It doesn't mean that you locked anybody up It doesn't mean that you actually got a conviction to a serious crime or protected the public from anything the real question is not Charging but dispositions of cases and that's real that that's the data that we need And I know there's a bunch of reporters who are trying to get that data and chase's office won't give it to him And so, you know, I would I would challenge this This little uh chase a volunteer, you know, go find out, you know, what what is the real data? On you know, how many felony charges have been pleaded down to misdemeanors, right? How many felonies have actually been prosecuted? How many felony convictions has Jason secured? It's interesting you bring this up.

If you do a search for GoFundMe Chesa Boudin, the number one result should be the the GoFundMe page I started it now has 455 donors and $54,000 in funding And so I am withdrawing the $54,000 and I have a meeting with the woman from the Marina Times Who's done great coverage of this and I'm also looking for some data scientists And I'm going to give the money minus some insurance for when Chesa sues me And some errors and emissions insurance and I'm going to be giving the $50,000 to a journalist or a data scientist Or they can spend it however they want to to attack this very issue Which is just put more sunlight on it.

And so Chesa Boudin is not happy with me. He's not happy with sacks But we are going to put the spotlight on him and it will be through journalism and it will be through constant pressure And you can help if you want to donate a hundred dollars go just donate it to that. I'm not taking any money obviously This is a really interesting civics experiment. I think for the rest of the country and I I want to say that I I don't know enough of these details. I go up to San Francisco every now and then I don't I've not liked what I've seen It's scary.

It's scary. Um, and it's great that you guys are standing up for your city The the thing is I wonder how much of these recall movements now will pick up steam Not just here, but wherever else they're allowable all around the country I mean, you know, the san francisco board of education spent all this time and money You know, basically naval gazing on the renaming of schools And then finally just because they were just so utterly embarrassed Basically had to bag that could you imagine that in the most technically advanced and most progressive? City in the world basically with the kinds of companies and people that we have here That that's what people were thinking about during the middle of a pandemic when children were at home.

Okay You have this da who's going to get basically recalled in Los Angeles. You have a da that's going to get recalled in california You have an entire, you know governor of the state that's going to get recalled. So what are we learning? We're learning that people can actually small numbers of people can be extremely effective at getting changed on Good for you guys that they represent us and that the distance between what the public Clearly wants and what some of these bought and paid for radically insane people both on the left and the right that needs to stop and if people are you know going to Not listen to their constituents.

We need to stop them people want people want centrism. They want simple center Reason people want reason Yeah, the silliness is that the san francisco board of education people Are elected When have any of you or any of the people that I know in san francisco ever actually looked up? Who's the person on the board of education? It's not really a topic that people have paid much attention to And I think that this experience when you don't pay attention from a civic perspective on who your elected officials are and take an action And in electing them you wake up when a crisis like this occurs and you're like, oh shit Maybe I should pay attention the next time there's an election and maybe I should be more active and be more thoughtful Or maybe we should end up in a situation where you allow the mayor or the board of supervisors to appoint the board And have an approval process where there's a little bit more kind of not just anyone that wants to get elected puts themselves on the ballot It gets elected.

No one really pays attention to who's getting elected and then you wake up to this crisis Isn't it true that like in the board of education? There was this the whole thing came to a head because they were trying to like staff a committee Again to waste time on some bullshit. Yeah, and here's some guy some guy raised his hand And you know, he happened to be this, you know gay person uh in a mixed cultural Marriage I think and he wanted to be a part of this committee and he had been kind of like a really good thoughtful participant And they said no because he wasn't diverse enough or something.

Yes, that's exactly that's exactly what happened There was a school board meeting it started at 4 p.m. Okay 4 p.m. And this was the first issue they discussed is whether the like you said this this gay white man was diverse enough to be on a committee It was a committee where he was volunteering his time time his good everybody thought that he'd be additive I mean, you know everybody liked him But they spent several hours debating whether they should put him on for diversity reasons because he wasn't he wasn't woke enough Right, exactly. Then they spent their time talking about renaming schools and taking abraham lincoln's names off schools And even renaming schools.

They didn't even know Why certain names were what they were wrong. They got the people wrong And then basically they didn't even get to the issue of school reopening until midnight So eight hours later and then everyone basically had gone to bed and the meeting ended I mean literally this is what happened. So the the parents it's like I said else get it's like insane It's it's insane. And so, you know, the parents are up in arms And this is triggering a recall movement because the parents just want the schools reopened and you keep getting these Responses from the school board where where they keep saying oh, we're listening to your concerns or whatever They keep trying to process them But they're not doing anything about it, you know And then and then they say well in order for us to reopen We need to establish our testing infrastructure and we're putting an rfp out for that and blah blah blah And it's like what are you talking about private schools have reopened just reopen, you know just reopen What do you guys think about um, joe biden's first sort of 60 days in office? Executing at a high level with the vaccine I mean opening up all those femo sites and getting to 2 million shots a day on average is undeniably great The fact that he used the war powers act to force murk and to to do the J Johnson and johnson and to work with johnson johnson to increase production undeniable um, I'm not and I'm not happy about you know The teachers and him cowtowing to the teachers and I'm not happy about Just the hint that he wants to start the war machine up again.

So, you know You know bombing syria Who wants who here wants to bomb syria? It's like a right of passage. I don't want to I don't want to Where where where the fuck is syria does anybody know? I mean why the what what what what are we doing? I mean That's the key issues for me. There's the teachers and the bombings. I don't want that I I'd say I give him an eight out of 10 Jason because I think the pandemic has been so well handled by him and zines and that team I think they've done a very good job But those two things those two things are huge black marks for me like And and bloomberg ripped him one, you know And mike bloomberg was on tv and he was just like that is a joke The teachers unions are jokes and you need to basically tear these people to the ground You have to they and you cannot allow these folks to hold An entire generation of kids hostage, okay But then and then the day I think it was the same day or the day after Unfortunately, biden kind of capitulated to the teachers union not cool And then this the bombing of syria was kind of like why? Yeah, let's use sanctions.

Let's use money. I mean the the legacy of trump. I think not starting wars Was the one thing and then him, you know, just backing up the brings truck for the light speed Those are the two best things he did and those are two things that we should say, you know what he got those things right Let's carry those forward. We have to crack the teachers unions Uh, the teachers union the voucher system is the only way to do it and it's very reasonable to say parents who are paying Shit tons of taxes should be able to take that money and educate their kids However, they damn please and if we're going to spend 15 20 000 per student on public education as a parent Whether you're in brooklyn or boise, idaho, you should have access that 15 k And you should pick where it goes and you should take control of it.

That's the way to stop this misugana Yeah, jakel. I had the I had the This crazy realization as you as you were saying this which is like if you said if I said to you You know electricians union, I would say thumbs up Auto workers union thumbs up seiu generally thumbs up Um nurses unions thumbs up, but if I say teachers union, I just have this incredibly negative connotation now of an incredibly political class of people who are going completely out of their way to basically just like have exceptions and asterisks that apply to them and them only It's I don't I don't am I the only one that feels that way.

It just seems like it's trending to where like teachers unions almost becoming a Four letter word. Yeah, I don't think they care about teachers. Yeah, they don't care about students These but unions in general do a very important job all the students Yeah, but I think unions in general do a really important job and I think that you know like all these other unions I have a very positive thought about what they're meant to be You you can be pro union or pro organized labor, but be against this specific union. That's what I'm saying just like you can be Uh pro reforming criminal justice and the unfairness of it while still being against Chesa buddha's insanity That people should be able to be murdered and killed and beaten in the streets punitive with impunity.

Well, like this is Yeah, these this is not an even This is a completely logical position to have I want to not put people in jail for cannabis sales And I want to remove people from non via for non filing of vendors from the the incarceration You can believe that while believing you should incarcerate somebody who murders somebody This is not a hard logic to understand Right, totally. No, you're right. I mean the the the it's it's a combination of ideology and special interests Um working against common sense and what the average citizen wants, you know, right? And it's not republican or it's not republican or democrat.

David, you and I agree on this and of course We just want common sense government that functions for the people as opposed to special interests or these radical ideologies I want to have a couple of pops at the battery and go walk to another bar without having to fear that somebody's going to stab me For my goddamn iPhone, you know or or or some poor kid's gonna get attacked by somebody deranged out of their mind on fentanyl Look, this is why nuisance is gonna get recalled is because crime and education are just fundamental issues We do not feel safe in our cities crime is out of control And we're going crazy that we can't send our kids to schools These are issues that affect cities and suburbs everyone's on the same page And I think you're right that the teachers unions have overplayed their hand and exposed themselves as not caring about the kids Just looking out for their own benefits.

They want to be on paid vacation forever Effectively and do you see there was a great example where an Oakley which is a town in the east bay the whole They were caught on recorded on zoom the hot mic Yeah, the hot there's a hot mic where the entire school board was forced to resign because they got caught mocking parents for For a quote wanting their babysitters back so they could smoke pot.
