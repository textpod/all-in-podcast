Model: Whisper-small

Shout out to Company sacks and I Despite how tired of am you I've woken up now now I'm awake you've awakened the dog. I'm done I quit I'll give a shout out to you which has got acquired by a Rainman David Hey everybody welcome to the all in podcast I'm Jason Calacanis with us today The Rain Man himself calling in from an undisclosed location the Queen of Kinwa and of course the dictator himself Chumath Pali Appatia All right boys. How are we doing feel flow energy today? What's going on great? How are you? What's going on? Let's go Let's do this.

I love it. Let's go All right, you're hot you're coming in hot. Yeah, yeah breaking news breaking news Biden has announced His capital gains Tax hike I don't think this impacts any of us but Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals from 20% to Not 25 not 28 39.6% to help pay for the social spending And in a quality for those earning one million or more so nobody on this call federal tax rates could be as high as 43% The capital gains increase would raise 370 billion over a decade Yada yada for New Yorkers the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%

in Californians 56.7% Biden has previously warned that those earning over 400,000 can expect to pay more in taxes This was just breaking news a couple of hours before we started the pod And the stock market is down And people are freaking out. Well, J. Cal. I want to hear your take on this actually I Was ranting on this topic 15 minutes ago we were talking and I'm like dummy. What did you think was gonna happen? You know He's saying they're going off. He's like, yeah, I'm gonna go back to the Capital gains taxes are the taxes you pay when you make an investment and you sell that investment at a profit You pay a tax on the profit you make and there's a difference between capital gains on the short term Which means less than one year and long term which means you've had the investment for more than a year So economic policy historically has dictated that having a low capital gains tax rate relative to what you know an income tax rate might make And that's what we're talking about Having a low capital gains tax rate relative to what you know an income tax rate might make it might be Incentivizes people to make long term investments and it you know gets more money moving in the economy and as a result You know the economy will grow and so the idea of increasing the long term capital gains tax from 20% Which it currently is to 40% is a real striking, you know economic policy shift Rationalized as you know, we're gonna save, you know, we're gonna use this money for social spending But I think the historical context and what this is is really important as we get into the conversation And just speaking historically, you know the the maximum tax rate on long term capital gains Got up to 40% sex.

You probably have the history on this in 1978 for a year right or like 76 to 78 and then it's been largely, you know, 15 to 20% for the last 20 years or so And so to jump up and prior to that in the early part of the 20th century like 25% pretty consistently for a long time So to jump up to 40% is a really big shift and there's a lot of debate around the economic implications of doing this I thought that was important. Yeah, let's take a step back and actually see the forest from the trees And the forest from the trees is that I don't think Biden Thinks that it's a credible plan in as much as I probably think He needs, you know, this is like it's performative because it was a lot larger the number the headline number was a lot larger Then what people were whispering was going to be the number, right? It was supposed to be like in the low 30s or maybe kind of like, you know, 33 34 And then all of a sudden like to come out of 39.6.

I think it's almost like, okay, he's he's giving the pound of flesh to The the left Kind of like woke mob of the Democratic Party who probably doesn't understand how capitalism works in the first place and doesn't care because they're not they're not participants in it now My reaction is I don't think it's going to pass. I think it's going to be really tough to get done and I think it probably, you know, maybe Maybe there's a watered down version, but this version I'm not super worried about and then it just comes back to the same thing over and over The the fewer the number of people that get to participate in the growth and see the upside the more there are that just wants to just kind of, you know, tear it all down And so I don't know it's just yet another signal that we have these structural issues to fix It's not reasonable that a few people get super rich and everybody else gets left on the sidelines Sacks where you thought it's not going to pass it, but it's not going to pass.

It's not going to pass Is it going to pass is in an opening salvo where he wants to get to 32 so he's starting at 39 I think I think it could pass because I think they're they're planning to do this tax increase as part of the second Infrastructure bill is not really an infrastructure bill. They're calling it human infrastructure. We've talked about this Infrastructure is one of the last categories of federal spending. That's still popular So they're rebranding a bunch of social programs as human infrastructure. I think that bill will pass I don't know if the the rate will stay at 39.6,

but I think there will be a big increase Clearly in the the cap gains rate. I mean, I think it's worth Remembering how it got to 20% it got to 20% because Bill Clinton lowered it from 28 to 20 as part of an overall package of Of tax reforms that he did in the in the sort of the the mid 90s And you know that led to some of the best years of economic performance GDP growth in the US productivity growth Deficit reduction You know and so You know, I think we're we're we are experimenting with breaking something that's been working.

I think pretty well since the the Reagan Kline years, which is to have you know, reasonably low Taxes on capital formation and investment I think it's a category error to treat Capital gains or to think about it just as income you have to remember that all of this money has already been taxed once right? So you make the money the first time as income you earn it you pay tax on it Then you decide to save some of it and invest it and then you get taxed again on that amount And so so capital gains is a form of double taxation That was the original reason one of the reasons to have a different tax rate for it and You know, I think that this risk kind of Messing up the economic recovery.

That's really underway already. By the way, think about what just happens to Any organization that has to pay cap gains, right? It's not just individuals like Last time I checked organization I was like, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that But I think that has to pay cap gains, right? It's not just individuals like last time I checked organizations aren't exempt from cap gains for profit organizations And I don't exactly know What they will do as well. So, you know, you you you're putting a lot of people under a huge strain when you double The effective rate of return.

So, you know, if you're for example, like a pension fund Right and you have an enormous investment in a private equity fund or a hedge fund Um, part of these things is that, you know, they're these complete pass through vehicles Um, and so as long as like you've structured yourself in a way where you don't have to pay that tax I think I guess you're indifferent but if you're any organization or institution or a person or collection of people That bears that tax all of a sudden, you know, your returns have been basically cut in half That's pretty nuts.

Let's talk about the average dough for a second or Jane as it were 401ks would take a hit here and then when you go to your retirement and you have to liquidate them You know, you don't pay tax on the you don't pay tax on that. Yeah, you don't pay tax on the 401k gains during the Otherwise your portfolio because 401k is going to be a small amount you can contribute to right of year So retirees who happen to have stock market gains or cryptocurrency people trading that Yeah, you'll basically pay the same as income tax as opposed to paying A lower tax so would a it'll diminish investment Jason It's exactly what David says which is that on the on a marginal basis What will happen is inflation probably goes up because people just decide to consume Rather than invest because they think well, what's the point? You know, there's already risk that I bear and so, you know, the the earliest risk assets, right? The riskiest ones that we all participate in which is early stage venture and company formation There's you you may not be thinking about the capital gains rate but it's implicit in the returns that you're expecting for the risk and the time you're going to take and You know, we've been trained to feel that rate And if you double that rate from 20 to 40, I suspect that there's a lot of people Who's risk tolerance changes and they're going to feel their after tax gains differently And the wonder to themselves is this worth it? And then I think what happens as a result is entrepreneurship drags I don't know if anybody's done An analysis, but I suspect part of the reason why America is such a You know an amazing like sink for capital, right? It absorbs capital all around the world Is that you've created incentives that get people very excited because they think they can get rewarded If you take those rewards away I think the implications are much bigger than just the cap gains rates here because as the people change their behavior Then the capital formation pools outside of the United States change their behavior and the whole thing has a knock on effect And it was more muted in clinton.

It was less muted in 78 It basically didn't exist in the 40s and 50s, but it is a huge force today I mean like we are an indebted nation that owes money to all kinds of countries around the world including china We're supposed to generate growth and sort of pay the back And where will the growth come from if lp's don't want to back venture funds or venture funds? But let's be a let's be honest and I'll check out. Let's be honest and direct. I mean are any of you guys going to change your Investment behavior if the cap gains tax goes to 40% No, but there'll be less of it You know, so look anything that's my behavior change.

I think my behavior will change. Yeah, how will it change? Because exactly what david said so I just put in a hundred million dollars into a climate change company two weeks ago Under this promise, um, I could only put in 50 So there's 50 million less progress that's going to happen on that business I'm not sure that that was that's the right answer for what that company is trying to do in the world And the way you're saying you're saying that you're saying the profits you would have had from before are diminished in half Therefore you would only have half as much money to invest as an investor Right.

So so however way you want to cut it whether it's like the 10 companies gets cut down into five Or the five 10 companies that I invest in get half my money The point is at some point The money starts to run out not just for me, but for everybody else Yeah, basically at the end of the day the money goes into the hands of you know, government legislators and administrators to decide how that money gets spent and it's not in the hands of capitalist investors to decide where to invest that that's the fundamental kind of Shift that that's gonna happen right right capital Capital's been taken out of the economy risk capital has been taken out of the economy and it's now going to be you know Spent by by government look anything that you You tax you punish and disincentivize and anything you subsidize you you've created in the center for there to be more of And you know, so this is just we always talk about these things in terms of who they're gonna hurt Is it that you know that this only falls on the backs of rich people? Um, so we shouldn't care but the real question is what is this going to do to the economy? And you know, I think we've talked in previous podcasts the last one that we have with brad gershner It feels like everything in the american system is kind of broken except for one thing which is this sort of opportunity economy That's that's been created by risk capital right and and people creating new companies, you know, like these big Stultifying political corporations the s&p 500 are completely broken Governments completely broken the federal debt is out of control Everything's the media is broken Everything in america is either broken or needs to be revitalized or reformed except one thing is working really well Which is risk capital and its allocation to founders who have nothing but a good idea, right? And when all of a sudden you double the cap gains rate that is an attack on that opportunity society now I think there is A legitimate conversation to be had about how do we spread? This sort of system of opportunity to more and more people I think like brad framed it really well in the last episode like how do we get more people involved in that? I would submit the answer has a lot to do with school choice and charter schools giving people everyone in this country Deserves to have a first rate education Um, and so that is a very legitimate conversation to have but I think to have punitive taxation on it Is I think it risk breaking that last thing that is working so well in in the american system I think it's really well said and uh, I think this is going to take Redomisiling to another level.

I mean if you're in new york or california right now and you were thinking about wyoming or utah or Texas or florida I mean this kind of makes the decision for you if it does go to 40 and because that's You could actually meet would you get to neutral if you left? and so I remember I remember when I moved to the united states in 2000 The marginal tax bracket that I was in and I was making maybe you know 100 no, I was probably making 80 or 90 thousand dollars a year was 55 percent And I remember coming to the united states and seeing my after my take home pay my first paycheck And I was shocked because I was like, you know, I was paying maybe 36 percent all blended in federal and local at the time or state at the time in california And slowly slowly it's creeping up with with if you've played out today where we are plus new york state just passed laws You're going to be sort of in the 50 to 55 percent almost upwards of 56 percent for certain folks And maybe the answer is that's the right thing Um, but I think we have to acknowledge that there's going to be a bunch of unintended consequences So maybe the intended consequence is to actually create more um equality between the richest few and you know Uh, not even the poorest frankly because but it'll just be the richest few and the the next richest few Quite honestly because like, you know, the investing class is still a small number of people Um, but the unintended consequences of that decision I think is what exactly what david said, which is that over the next five or ten year period You will at a practical level see less investment And the the only way to make that whole is if the government then takes all that money And all of a sudden allocates it from their own coffers back into the economy and we know that that's not going to happen Well, right that's just going to be riddled with waste and graft and corruption So unfortunately the setup is that you know, you're going to really impact entrepreneurship And then and then I wondered to myself by the way guys like What was the actual goal of this meaning there was 20 or 30 guys that were just making so much money on their equity But then that's then then we need to blame like the these lists like the Forbes billionaires list because those are inaccurate because a lot of these Stuff is like un Realized Realized paper gains Yeah Right and so they're not they're not paying any capital gains because they haven't sold anything and most of these guys that are uber uber rich You know have no desire to sell because it's for them.

It's a control issue to sell I'm not sure the I'm not sure the the consequence of taxing uber rich people Is the true motivation? I think for some people maybe it is but If we just take a step back, I mean a year ago The u.s. Debt level was significantly lower than it is today We've taken on a tremendous amount of of federal debt to fund a series of programs that we believe we're going to kind of keep You know the american population employed and keep our economy moving That was a massive burden. We accrued and in the past year So ultimately over time the only way to kind of support this this new federal budget And you know the this new servicing costs that we've taken on at the government level You really only have kind of like three options option one is you're going to continue to raise more debt and massively Kind of inflate everything and the dollar declines in value Option two is to reduce spending Which means starting to cut these programs and option three is to raise taxes And it's pretty clear that option one is one where we're kind of already at the economic limit Option two is going to be very hard to swallow at a time like this So you can't just cut spending right now Across the board so many aspects of the u.s.

Economy and so many individuals in the united states are dependent on the federal government for support And so option three is the only real one that's left on the table And so then the question is who are you taxing? You're not going to go tax the people that are struggling You're going to tax the corporations and the wealthy and the and the capital gains tax is the one place where you can kind of say Look the tax rate that you're paying today is half of what an income tax rate would be if you were earning that as income Let's get it to be fair and even and I think just just to argue this other side Like there's a motivation.

There's a point of view where this is coming from. It's not just let's go tax the rich Screw the economy It's that we find ourselves in a circumstance where we need to do one of those three things the most rational to do is to It or the most kind of sensible politically To do is to is to increase taxation and this is the the first place to go the most obvious place to go It's not because so when you think about like so for example, like, you know, you would say, okay Who are the folks that we're talking about? There can be entrepreneurs that are building companies Again, they're never selling so they're never going to pay these taxes Like it's not the case that elon musk or mark zuckerberg Is all of a sudden going to write a 40 billion dollar check because that's that's not how much they make That may be how much they're worth, but they will never sell a single share unless they have to to fund some other project In which case so which of those three things would you do tomorrow? So so what I was going to say is so and then and then you look at somebody else Like maybe you say oh well, you know the people that manage money like let's go after those guys because like those guys shouldn't be You know rich but then the problem is those guys are already paying w2 income They're already paying nominal income tax rates.

That's how the entire hedge fund industry works right now, you know You get paid in current income And so okay, so you're not getting their money because they're already paying at the prevailing rate So again, this goes back to if you actually Trace the problem and see who it affects. It's exactly what david said It's these folks that are in the middle that are actually putting the money to work That are trying to invest in things that now have a very different return profile And you're right the core business that they do they may still keep doing But then all of the incremental things in the future that they want to do they won't do for example Look at all of the talk right now about how everybody needs to stand up, you know More angel investing more minority investing more women gps all of this stuff Well, all of the folks let's just be honest all the folks that are in a position to put money into those folks Are now 50% on a dollar rated basis poorer if this thing passes and I bet you what they're going to do is they're not going to cut their allocations in Sequoia They're going to cut their allocations to all these other folks.

Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking Tramath is Who's it going to hurt? It's again, it's going to hurt all the people that you want to get into the game It's going to hurt all the people that are here But the richest richest rich folks that is not unless you impact but unless you expropriate the money from them That's not you're not going to get a single cent and then that was the that was the concept of the wealth tax Wasn't it that you would take the total value what you have and just take away 1% a year From bezos's, you know or zuckerberg's hundred billion dollars So would that not have been a better solution than this if you had to pick one a 1% wealth? That's a slippery slope over whatever Jason Then we're no better than a banana republic that could also then expropriate a mine Because we don't like the way that the mining is happening or you know Another critical asset because the government decides that it's important I mean, what's the difference between a stock and any other asset that either a person or or corporation owns it's it's it's very Brit, I think that the definitions are thin.

They're all the same things at the end of the day So let's go back. Let's go back to the federal budget problem. Like how do you address it sacks? I mean, what's the right course here? What I think is amazing is we're we're about to spend we're raising this Hundreds of billions of taxes in order to fund, you know trillions of new spending I don't really hear the administration selling These new programs selling the spending all we're really talking about is that there's too many rich people You know, we have these millionaires and billionaires. We got a tax and more And so all all we're really talking about is whether it's appropriate to be punishing The rich and super rich.

We're not really talking about where is this money going? Are these programs justified? What do we get out of it exactly and my point is forget about like who it's gonna hurt I think it's eventually gonna hurt the economy And the question is what do we get out of it? And I think what's amazing is this isn't even paying for the big ticket items On the progressive wish list. We're not getting to universal Um healthcare with this we're not getting to universal higher education We're not getting to any of the we're not getting to like forgiveness of student loans or anything like that We're not getting to any of the really big ticket items on the progressive wish list And yet we're maxing out the taxes relative to anything we've done historically And so where do you go from here? You know, because my thinking is this is this this is the tip of the iceberg in terms of of the progressive agenda Doesn't that speak to the problem like the fact that we have such an extraordinarily high debt burden and federal budget That we're kind of scrambling to figure out a way to kind of make ends meet effectively, right? I mean because our alternative again is to just let massive inflation run You know issue a ton of a ton of new debt or to cut spending.

No, no, no, but david either of those seem to be on the table No, no, no, you're going to exacerbate this issue. I'm I'm telling you I know it doesn't seem likely But I think on a marginal basis. This will be an incentive to spend And the reason is that it's a very frustrating idea for somebody to think about putting money in the ground especially a sophisticated investor Um at a rate of return that just changed in half And so from my perspective, I would be more likely to spend because I would rather just yolo the money Then I would rather put it into the ground because I would be worried that that could then get taken away from me It could also change even further and further and that I think that's a very Frustrating idea.

I'd rather take a vacation again. Let's go back to the example I'd rather take a vacation with that $10,000 Then go on to Jason's syndicate and put it into the hands of folks because I'm just like, you know what? It's going to turn into even if even if Jason hits it and I get back, you know, I'd rather just go on vacation Enough of those decisions and I think I think you have a very different kind of economy You have you know what you have you have what everybody else has so do we reduce spending? I think you have to reduce expenses I think that we have an infrastructure that is not well accounted for meaning if you're a company You can go to a company like tableau.

You can go to a company like, you know, pick your pick your metrics company And within, you know, a few weeks and months of work, you can literally understand where all the dollars are Right, you can understand your business and you can figure out where money is being wasted and where it's not In a government that's impossible to do Right because you have these laws and these laws are artificial constructs that we construct And those artificial constructs are influenced by money in and of itself And so these dollar flows are impossible to map so you don't know where it goes.

So for example The $700 billion budget in the Pentagon does anybody have any idea what the ROI is on that or even a way to measure it? Like even to actually make it simple Well, like if you were if you had $700 billion of investment capital The the market has a really simple way of saying, okay, David What's your roik? What's your return on invested capital? And you can say all kinds of fancy things you can have all kinds of fancy projects or simple projects But at the end of the day, what is measurable is a dollar in and what that dollar grew into and that's a return on invested capital It is impossible to know that And so, you know, we could say for example, you could define it and say well I'm going to basically get every single person to graduate high school And now I'm going to spend $500 billion a year to make sure that the graduation rate is 100% That would be an incredible goal.

You know what that is absolutely measurable, right? And and you'd be able to back into all of these programs and the ones that didn't work you'd cut You know, and you'd end up with what David said, which is school vouchers I mean just I think I think the absence of that accountability Chumat has led us to a scary dilemma and the dilemma is Over 10 million Americans are directly employed by federal government And a large swath of the remainder of the economy is supported by federal government spending Which is basically your point, right? So large large large amounts defense and military construction health care and pharma I mean the list goes on but like the direct employees of the federal government plus the amount of revenue that depends on federal spending Is so significant now as a percent of the total income generated by Americans That it is very hard to say like let's create accountability in a system when so much of the economy is functionally dependent on it Am I missing something sacks like I mean, isn't that the circumstance we're in right now? Yeah, I mean the thing that like is amazing to me is you know, I lived through the 1980s and 1990s like like you guys did From 1982 to 2000 that 18 year period we had Sort of an unrivaled economic performance.

It was roughly around we had two bad years under George Herbert Walker Bush That's why he lost reelection, but we had close to 40% growth in GDP Every year we had great productivity Um, and we had massive deficit reduction. It's the last four percent a year in GDP. Yeah, and we and we had we actually had government Surpluses budget surpluses the last few years So it seems to me that we had the winning formula As a country and look, this is not partisan. I think it's bipartisan I think the the right solution is somewhere between what what Reagan and and bill Clinton did and you know Clinton He rose he increased the individual tax rate to 39.6.

So he did do that From 36 percent, but he cut it from he cut the investment to the cap gains rate from 28 to 20 It was in that ballpark. You know, we know that works, you know, we know that works I and and and you know somehow we've moved away from what we learned in that time period because you know, I think the Left in this country has has become Kind of you know has embraced this we're saying the same thing you set up the incentives for people to invest They do if you set up the incentives for people to spend They will do that as well.

I see this I think shamath is exactly right There are a lot of people and you use the example of the syndicate.com when I do my syndicate deals There are people who are recreationally saying, you know what? I love the idea of putting five or ten k into a flyer They're gonna, you know, half of them will go away a third of them all these people who are, you know involved in day trading or crypto or real estate investing They're gonna look at and say is this worth the time or is it worth this amount of time? Maybe I'll cut back from doing 40 hours a week of this to 20 And if you look at what happened with crypto people, they went to port eureco You look what happened to venture capitalists and CEOs.

They went to florida. Miami austin This is gonna If it does pass you could be pushing people to singapore Well, we have another very complicated problem and this is what free bird brought up which is and I don't know the answer, david So I'm trying to I'm actually talking around your question because I think it's it's it's the right absolute question But think about this. What happens in a world where now let's just say that the revenue of the government goes up, right? But outcomes stay the same or get worse And at the same time, you know, and you could claim that that's effectively what's been happening over the last 20 or 30 years Right government revenues have gone up impact has stayed the same or probably been net negative But then at the same time you have this, you know, program of quantitative easing where then you can essentially print money on demand and When you think about that it's like, wait a minute.

I am giving you money But then then you are also going to the photocopying machine with my money to make more money And all of that total money does less than what it did when it was half that or a quarter or a third of it That's a very scary realization. I think that people, you know, will eventually come to And I don't know what the answer to that is. I you know, I I think David Saxe who said it was just like, you know, the states are this incredible a b test, right? Because you get to test like theories, right? And you have you have now every complexion of theory you have like, you know, the low tax states the no tax states the mid tax states You have high real estate taxes low real estate taxes highest state tax whatever you get every grab bag of incentives And you're going to see but the problem is that was assuming that the federal government kind of mostly stayed out of the way Right.

You have this massive overlay. Yeah, I just posted a chart in the chat that Nick can put up Which is federal spending federal outlays of percentage of GDP And it's really interesting because federal outlays of percent of GDP have generally been Around the 20% line plus or minus a couple of percent since you know the 1980s and last year in 2019 it was 20.7 percent It jumped to 31.3 percent under covid and it now feels like we're trying to make this new level Of you know going from 20 to 30 permanent It's like mask mask wearing well the the problem is the only time we did that in history was in world war two Now we were trying to fight the nazis which was worth spending the money on yeah I would say that was a good use of capital But it's very step back right I mean once the ruin what what starts out as temporary becomes permanent Is that kind of the concern? Well, that's what that's what melton freeman said is there's nothing quite so permanent as a temporary government program right But but but what what they're threatening to make permanent is this new permanently higher level of federal spending in the economy And I think it's a very dangerous experiment because it either takes Tremendous money printing to support it or a tremendous tax burden and neither one of them is good for the economy By the way, you know again when bill clinton left office I remember you know you can go to the the time machine for white house dot gov When he left in 2000 and he bragged about how? Under his terms under his eight years as president they reduced federal spending from 22 percent Yeah, what happened to that to 18 percent of the economy.

Can you imagine a democrat today? boasting of that or even a republican I mean What who was the guy who was your guy who was like the tea party people who there was somebody who was like in charge of the set Rant who I don't know who was but it was just like we got a cut spending the way I think that's funny. Oh, yeah Ryan the speaker the speaker of the house paul ryan. Yeah, you're right. You're right Based on this yeah spending restraints kind of gone out the window and in both parties and the republic and it did it did happen under trump the republicans Don't seem to find their principles on spending unless and until there's a democrat in the white house So they definitely deserve their share of the blame on this but but we do seem to be entering a new territory here Of you know this again Levels of spending we've never seen before it's incredible.

That's absolutely the problem The problem is it would be so much better if we just said we're going to do this one very specific thing With a huge number attached to it like I would rather say we're going to mars. Here's a trillion dollars We're cutting student debt. Here's a trillion dollars We're going to double down on cyber and we're going to get you know Completely pivot the military or something and here's 500. You know, whatever something aspirational That is not just anti rich people. Let's tax right now We have we have a label we have a label and then we have a spaghetti mess of spending that just isn't really attached to what the label means And none of it is accountable.

And so you don't really get anything for it. I know this is a silly question But why wouldn't we test this and say hey 20 40? There are numbers between these two Maybe we'll increase it 2% a year for eight years And we'll see what happens. This is this is the other problem with like this idea of american exceptionalism We believe that we can't learn anything from anybody else and that's also not true We actually know what it looks like when you have government as a massive portion of the economy When we also know examples where government basically enables human capital outcomes But remains relatively, you know small and fixed Singapore, right? There's this there's incredible.

Yeah, you know, there's this incredible example where I think right when Lee Kuan Yew became The head of Singapore the GDP of Singapore was the same as the GDP of Jamaica Right and what you saw was this complete just just complete divergence in in these two countries And think about this country, which is basically this like, you know, this little spot of land And surrounded, you know, and you know, apolitical A religious surrounded by these Muslim countries and they still thrived and they kicked ass, you know, they were never invaded etc etc Um and underneath that was this belief that it's what you said free berg where you focus on an outcome You spend against the outcome and you try to measure in a reasonable way And you double down on the things that work and then on the other hand if you look at Europe Europe is a good example when you know spending sometimes for the greater good in the best interest can run amok And really what happens is you start to stagnate? Yeah, and Singapore is only what six million people.

I mean, it's like Ireland or Norway or Denmark. I mean, it's this is not a huge place. Sounds like we didn't solve any problems in that last piece We didn't solve I mean, I mean, what do we think is going to happen in four years? So does Donald does this give Donald Trump a clear path into office if he said, hey, we're Well, you could you could you know the worst case scenarios you see what happened in France when they had that 75% super tax and then they introduced the wealth tax and they had massive immigration of Of invested dollars out of the country and people out of the country.

They did get rid of George didn't they? That was a bonus. He was a bonus. Yeah. Yeah At what point how many red pills do you guys have to take? Before you're willing to reassess your political party because it seems obvious to me now look we could talk about How about a political party? Hold on. Hold on. We can talk about we can talk about how bad the Republican Party is But there's no question in my mind that the Democratic Party all the energy the base the activists and the politicians who have the microphone They are woke socialists.

Okay. That is the dominant ideology in the Democratic Party and what Biden is doing right now Is catering to that he's compromising with it. He wasn't catering to that until this point He he didn't put Bernie or Elizabeth Warren into any cabinet positions He kind of marginalized them and now He's like, okay, let's do something. I mean would Warren and this is this is why I think yeah, but Jason I think you're right. This is why I think this is like a sacrificial lamb and I don't think anything's gonna happen I don't I think Biden is a fundamental centrist.

That's why I like him. I think he's a boring He's a stable. He's a stable predictable figure and that's I think what you want in the in the presidency I I think that this is sort of like, okay, you guys want a pound of flesh here you go But I think he's so politically smart that he probably does have a bunch of millennial Woke socialists whispering and chattering like hey do this do that to the other But he's probably the only one there who's smart enough to realize none of this won't get passed You know, it's not gonna muster enough support.

I don't know. I think I Biden is not governing like a centrist right now He's he's proposing, you know, what four trillion of new spending You know new tax increases and he's just getting started But look and I would challenge this idea to slightly of him being a centrist What I would say is he's always tacked to the center of the Democratic Party so I do I I do think he's he's a triangulate triangulator and A calibrator he's not like a conviction politician the way that a Bernie Sanders is or an Elizabeth Warren But what he's tacked to is the center of the Democratic Party and the center of the Democratic Party has moved very far left Because all the activists have moved to the left and so he's been dragged left remember Biden was Clinton's floor manager in the Senate when he passed all this legislation And so now Biden is very far to the left of where Biden was in the 1990s And the reason for that is because the Democratic Party has moved So once again, I guess, you know, my question to all of you guys is what does it take? How far does the Democratic Party have to go? to the left Donald Trump I wouldn't call this the problem is don't call this as much of a radical policy shift as I think it's being framed I honestly think this is a natural and inevitable consequence of the circumstances We find ourselves in right now with respect to the spending level The dependence we have on federal spending across the board with respect to individual employment and the economy The need for a variety of social services to get us through this COVID economic collapse I just don't see another way out and I feel like it's the natural course to do exactly what's going on right now I think it's gonna pass.

I think something like it's gonna pass I think something like it's gonna pass, but I don't think it's gonna pass Yeah, we're gonna put it out. You think it's gonna be equidistant? I'm not saying it's good or bad I think obviously we just find ourselves in this circumstance in this country in this moment in time That this is the only path I'm just not sure you can go in and go slash a ton of spending right now And and you know and anyone would win reelection or any, you know, or most Americans would be anything but unhappy It's just it's just a consequence of where we are.

Let's play the glass half full. Here's a crazy idea. Okay You know, for example, somebody like me what I would think about which I think is is a little it's crazy But I would do it Is okay I'm just going to move literally every single thing every dollar that isn't nailed down Into a charitable vehicle and I will invest through my charity Because I still have to donate five percent a year, but then I can compound tax free Now I care more about the businesses that I'm a part of and the progress that I can create So that may be okay And I'll just pay myself a salary to like fund my lifestyle But that could be a way around this to me the biggest issue isn't how much money I have Personally the biggest issue is how much money I will have to put back into the world And the idea that then it goes to a place where it's profligately spent in a way that is Really bothers me that idea bothers me a lot David that would cause me to tack You know more even more to the right if I could find somebody who understood that principle because what I don't want to have is You know in the absence of social programs like the the problem that the republicans leave is this no man's land Where then you're forced to believe that this one man for yourself.

It's all about you you can figure it out You know the rugged individualism that's just not realistic like I I Well am a complete byproduct of a social safety net and that should exist And the problem is that republicans don't give you that option to have then accountability on spending and just somebody please just say that I don't care what you call yourself Yeah, well look, I think you know the I think republicans have gotten a lot more comfortable with the idea of entitlements and the Social safety net. I don't really hear anyone opposing that anymore Um, I mean it's the same things happened with like the tories in In england, you know, no one's really trying to roll back the social safety net We need a republican messenger to come forward and say listen, we don't care You know who you love what you smoke where you're from what you look like You know, we believe in an opportunity society.

We want to spread that opportunity to everybody But ultimately opportunity comes from the private sector. We're gonna have a strong social safety net and we're gonna basically give everybody The the most opportunity to participate by giving them a great education. That's basically what the agenda should be. Yeah, I'm in I'm in I mean, I to your point even the starting line. Hallelujah. I like it. I mean, I I would The problem is your boy tried to dismantle obamacare, you know, unfortunately the problem is trump like trump I'm a never trump or obviously, but I'm kind of purple I would you know, I'm considering austin or miami as a place to locate myself and A decision like this makes it easier.

I would never do that I'm actually very I love texas. I love austin austin's the kind of purple I like Like I like personal freedom and I like what you're saying like love who you love smoke what you want What year did you move to the bay area? five six years ago I was in LA for 10 new york for 30 I feel like it's a last in first out thing that's going on right now with respect to immigration out of california I've been here since 2000. I'm not leaving. Yeah, I've been here my since I was six years old in california And I'm not leaving and I've been in the bay area since college So I'm not you know, I feel like it's a lot harder to leave when you've been here longer It's a lot easier to leave when you've been here less time That certainly seems to be the pattern I've seen amongst friends and colleagues with respect to leaving the state All right, the show of in trial came back guilty all three charges What is there to even talk about here? What is there to talk about? I don't I don't even know I feel like why would you like can I can I give it can I give a shout out to um A really good friend of mine.

His name is neil kachal. He was the former source that are general under obama um He he was one of the prosecutors that that worked on that case He's a he's a partner at hogan's Brunson supreme court practice here, but basically went and did this pro bono trial uh on behalf of the state of minnesota i'm working with the the The district attorney and i'm just i just want to say neil proud of you. It's an incredible thing Thank you for keeping Cut say okay, I mean, uh, you know, it's crazy But then you know the same day there was there was a shooting of this This unfortunate shooting of this I think I think she was 16 year old 16 years old this black girl in Ohio and then you know LeBron tweeted something out and then LeBron had to basically delete the tweet because it was causing people to go absolutely crazy Well, I mean each of these situations is unique And in that situation somebody was going to stab another person the cop didn't know what was going to happen and You know in another time period like maybe that would have been saving somebody's life who had potentially been stabbed and You know the george floyd I think you got a reserve judgment on each of these Until you get all the information but the information here was just super conclusive like the the the gymnastics bend ship hero and some of these far right people had to go through To say what you saw in george floyd being murdered was not what happened Well, that's that's performative theater trying to get people to watch something and it was I mean it was just gross to watch You might as well call it what it is like that's acting I feel like probably if anybody if any one of us found ben Shapiro in a bar and just hung out and had a beer You'd find out that he was like he was like the meryl Streep of our generation, you know like this incredible actor Like an incredible actor I think Adams and his pockets all these guys are just trying to figure out how to say That this was a travesty of justice and I'm like, I don't know what you saw but yeah, let me explain where they went wrong Okay, so so look I I agree with you guys fundamentally.

This was an easy Look, this this was uh, you know finding a fact by the jury guilty on all charges obvious right the tape shows it his uh, the chauvin's Record as a cop numerous complaints, you know, this was a bad apple. This was a bad cop He deserved to be convicted and a story that's really the analysis should end But of course the people on cable news would have nothing to say if that was the end of it And so look, I think both the right and the left kind of went off the rails on this where You know, the right kind of went off the rails is you had well What happened is you had maxine waters, you know come out and while the the jury was still deliberating She was basically calling for activists to get more confrontation on the streets if the verdict went the wrong way And so then the defense helpful not helpful, right? And so the so then the the defense made a motion Saying that uh, this this was affecting the deliberations.

There's no proof of that the jewel the judge ruled against that motion But he did the judge reiterated his desire for the politicians to stop talking about the case, right? And so then what happened is the the right wing commentators Were criticizing maxine waters and implying that that there was an effort to try and coerce the jury And there's no proof of that, right? And and and and I think there's the mistake is in somehow framing Derek Chauvin as like a sacrificial lamb to the mob. He was not he was guilty He deserved it that being said I do think that the judge had a point that it would be Helpful if these politicians would just stay out of it stop commenting on it while the jury is deliberating.

I think there was a legit point there But you know the the the the left made some some weird comments as well. You had Nancy Pelosi made this really Bizarre strange. I think that was like a slip up of like Just trying to say something not I mean being charitable. She was trying to say something nice That George Floyd is going to create a wave of justice and that would be that's a great idea She said yeah, she said thank you George Floyd for sacrificing your life for for justice. Yeah, that didn't come out exactly As she and no no, I mean because look George Floyd did not go out that day intending to be a martyr No, no, you know and and so it it it sort of It expressed kind of what she's thinking, which is how am I going to use this politically? You know It came out pretty gross, right? It came out gross for sure.

I think that's how they're trained It's kind of like, you know, if you if you take a finely tuned athlete into sport and give them, you know They're just they're reactive because they're so instinctual. I think it's kind of like this. She's an incredibly finely trained athlete in her domain is politics and so You know, what is that phrase? Every crisis is an opportunity kind of thing. So I think I think that's a great idea So I think yeah, I mean they all flew there to be there for the for the trial, etc And that couldn't have helped the judge with you know, the impartial jury and maybe that causes a mistrial I mean, I don't know David.

You're an attorney Is there any chance on appeal that a maxi? Water quote like that could Result in well the judge actually said that that the defense could reserve that issue and use it on appeal So yeah, they could use it but but I don't think it's good. I don't think it's gonna work unless they can prove That somehow the jury was contaminated by what they were hearing on tv or something like that The judges instructions were pretty clear like I watched a couple of the ending days and he's very clear like he's like guys I don't want you to watch the news, you know, there's stuff like that He was very directive in making sure that they tried to be as uncontaminated as possible So I think the the surface area for an appeal is pretty thin here The fact that the police chief and everybody who worked with him said like this is not standard this and they just threw him right under the bus They didn't want to be associated with this in any way By the way, well, you know, they're they're not going to be able to hide much longer though because the doj said they're opening an investigation into minnesota police force So I think they're just trying to crack open the police reform in that state and just kept those guys on the right side And it's going to be you know, again, here's this other issue where it's like, okay This is where like it's very difficult for the federal government to do anything But you know, so whatever they try to do won't really result in what what you want have because every state again Jason to your point Has completely different political ideologies.

Nobody wants to behave the same everybody wants to be independent Everybody wants to get reelected as not cowtowing to somebody else And so you just don't get these consistent outcomes And then people are forced to vote with their feet and move across the country You know to get a bunch of simple things that I think should be pretty consistent across the entire country The thing that I found is particularly deranged was these people who are like listen, he's a fentanyl addict He's an opioid addict which by the way, there are tons of affluent people everybody in this country is addicted to opioids Fentanyls are everywhere Fentanyl is everywhere and then you're trying to say like because he had that addiction But in some way that negates the person kneeling on his back while he's in handcuffs Like you're you have a duty as a police officer to take care of somebody when he's in handcuffs How is he any threat in any way and then to listen to scott adams and ben Shapiro on these absolute Pieces of garbage try to say oh, you know, there was the fentanyl that killed him.

It's like Uh, yeah, no the person on his back kneeling on him for nine minutes because it's about it's about ratings now Switching topics and to talk about ratings something a little later um The most interesting popcorn thing that I watched was the hulu documentary You did watch the hulu documentary on we work. I'll be working out. Oh, I gotta watch it. I gotta watch it. I haven't seen it yet Yeah, it is it is in a word. I think I think the good I think the right word is like Outrageous, I think the guy who stole it jason was the lawyer who they interviewed.

Yep. He he had some incredible kind of like one Miners, yeah, uh, but I think it's yeah the I had a g I I'll be honest and this may sound crazy, but I actually had Um a fair amount of sympathy for adam newman and watching it I think that he at least in the documentary it came out that he you know Not not that he didn't create this issue But that I think it was a little overly scapegoated because it's very hard for you to incinerate 45 billion dollars without the complicity at a minimum of your board of directors Right and and a bunch of like extremely well healed thoughtful investors Um, and so there was just there was just so much complicity in this thing So if anything my takeaway was that he he shares He shares the blame with a lot of other people and it's not it wasn't You know him and him only but my gosh that documentary some of the things guys are just uh, they're fabulous This is always true in these businesses that end up with um, you know bad actors that are enabled, right? I mean it's been the case in public and public success stories and failures, right? I mean there's a a cult of personality The personality provides the the high beta personality provides the alpha And it can also it could also could provide like a theranose outcome and You know the the thing that when you'll see when you watch this is I don't have you guys watch the vow about that nexium cult which is just Equally loads of horrible people behaving badly, but he really targeted young people to work there and indoctrinated him into this We're changing the world And then there were no adults there and you see him behind the scenes when he's talking At the ipo roadshow and he's having basically a panic attack and he's psychotic I mean he was really deranged and they have this video of him trying to get through the ipo roadshow What show is the work movie it is It's the we work documentary documentary just get who it is so deranged It's awesome.

I mean it's fire festival level deranged is a big word. I don't I'm not sure that it's deranged But I think it's like it's juicy It's it's got his wife and like that whole thing like we school they're like we have to democratize Education Have you guys ever regretted enabling? You know quirky personality entrepreneurs that you've backed and then you've regretted it later Yeah, so um The problem is it's hard it's hard to know in the midst of it You know, I guess it's like kind of like that line like the line between genius and insanity is very thin Um, but yeah, I mean the the one thing I will say is I've only ever had one issue of outright fraud um And so you know do tell Well, no, I mean in hundreds of in hundreds of companies that I've that I've invested in And luckily I've I've only Uh, I've only seen one issue where you know, the ceo was extremely I don't know aggressive in how they accounted for and booked revenue and You know, this is where one thing that we don't have at the early stage companies We don't have the check and balance of a reporting infrastructure and a third party watchdog and all these other people And so, you know, you guys all know this when we go in and we sit in a meeting In a board meeting and you know, the entrepreneur puts slides up There is an inherent 100% categorical belief that they're that they aren't lying, right? Like you don't you don't even have to check that assumption It's just assumed that nobody's lying, you know good or bad.

We're just presenting the data And I had one case where the guy lied and it wasn't one was it was and our CFO and you know, our team figured it out and um, you know, there were other investors and it was uh We all were just really shocked and we had to kind of clean it up as best we could and I have literally a dozen And they we didn't wind up investing in I think 10 of the 12 and the reason is We took diligence to your point Sharmath like do you how do you even know in a board meeting? I just said screw it I'm going to build the diligence team and we ask people for all their bank statements And for their iTunes account and for their google analytics and if a company doesn't give those to us We just know that something's up and we figure it out before we invest because the two times we did get dinged on this We had one where somebody was giving themselves alone and so you do diligence we did We just basically have a diligence list that says give us the incorporation docs and all these bank statements now somebody could Fraudulently change a bank statement that is possible.

So there it depends on how deep people want to go in the fraud But did you guys ever like enable a personality that was just like so over the top and then you're like, oh shit This is actually gonna this is actually an explosion. Like it's a total disaster. Only my top three investments That's a good point there because yeah, so because okay, so I wrote about this in my blog post Blitz fail About the the sort of how yeah, how founder psychology can actually cause a company to go off the rails who's in offense the the thing the thing is that Founder founders do need to be much more aggressive than the average person You know, we like to think that a quality that a personality trait like aggressiveness There's like some sort of normal distribution of it and you kind of want to be you know Somewhere in the middle of the curve and it's actually not true You want founders to be much more aggressive than the average person because if they're not they're just not going to persevere And push hard enough, right and J.

I mean we saw this with with uber, right? I mean tk was a super aggressive personality the company would not have been as successful. How do you not push that hard? And so The curve in the real world. It's not a normal distribution It looks more like a curve where there are returns to aggressiveness and they're keeping increasing returns to it Until suddenly the person goes too far and then they jump the shock and the whole thing craters Can I say something like you know having been in the engine room with zuck in a critical moment Zuck was an aggressive guy, but he wasn't over the top and he wasn't just this like crazy weirdo personality He wasn't enabling sexual harassment.

He wasn't doing any of that stuff. Would you say? Yeah, he was he was he was he was an intellectually incisive. He was an aggressive thinker So this is why my reaction to david's question is I haven't backed assholes because I just think that that archetype doesn't work It's not because of very cool analytical personality. There are these founders that you know, we um, I've heard the term wild stallion to uh to describe them where they are, you know, they're like these these wild stallions They have tremendous upside, but they're also a little bit, you know, um wild and unless they sort of learn to get him with the hoof Yeah, I mean the hoof They're they're they've got a lot of talent, right? Uh, the the talent is The the amount of talent you have is like the horse you're riding on and some people are riding on a bronco They got a lot of talent, but it might just think I just think the real the real edge in investing is figuring out What is bluster and window dressing and show and what is actually aggressive thinking like john and patrick collison? There's zero bluster with those guys Yeah, those guys that company that company's gonna be zero that's gonna be the most valuable valuable company that's private right now Besides these guys are these guys are incredible intellectually thoughtful killers.

Right. That's they are that's true They outthink everybody but there's also a maturation process a lot of founders go through right the call sands and zuck I think got very mature very young. I think there's other founders that it takes them a while to Get more polished get more disciplined rain in that, you know, those emotions. I'm not saying they're fraudulent We don't want to bet on fraudulent founders, but some founders need to learn how to harness the talent they have Yeah, I agree with that. I agree with that And and those are the ones where it's very hard to know earlier in their career whether to bet on them or not, right? I agree because they may get it under control or they may not it's you can't tell at the beginning Here's the analogy we use internally It's like being professor x and the x men you could have a gene gray or a wolverine and like everybody's got a different Superpower, but you need to teach them how to use that superpower so they don't self destruct or By for kp other way, right? They could be magneto, right? You could could go the other way Not sure I get all the references, but I hear you Well, I mean i'm kind of shocked given how much of a huge nerd you are I don't understand the x bench jason movie.

I love that movie with the guy who's made of all the rocks and the little tree guy Who's his buddy that's a guardian to the galaxy. Yes. I think I think jason's favorite character is the blob What are you talking about how many how many cubano sandwiches are you having? How many cro no croquettes sacks Bad idea shouldn't have gone there. You're right. Yeah So I sounded what is your training? Well, what's that? What is your health plan? Are you now that we're coming out of kovat? Are you running or? You do look a little bloated you look like a you look like a puffed fish.

Oh jeez. I need to lose like 20 pounds I'm down 12 from my peak of the kovat peak. I'm feeling good Just get a personal trainer speaking of kovat. What the hell is going on in india? Oh my lord is scary I thought the whole thing was we would they were taking hydroxychloroquine for totally different reasons and this is why it's all fine They had some immunity or that it was hot I mean there was a million reasons of why they were not going to get hit and then now they're surging and we have 60 million shots on the shelf and the number of people getting shots is going down.

This is america's chance to use instead of battleships and nuclear weapons, we can use this kovat to shape global policy We should be getting vaccines to other countries and be once again the shining light of the entire planet and humanity. Well, why are we not bringing shots to india now? We have so many extras. I'm not sure. I'm just trying to pull up the india of vaccine data per day. I'm not sure that there's a That's as much of the issue, right? I mean it is scary to watch there. I mean you're you're our go to science guy freeberg Tell us what we're looking at here on this chart.

I mean the daily kovat cases are now hitting 250,000 300,000 adages It broke 300. Oh my lord and the united states has gone down to like 50 60 India that's under 800 India has now passed the peak of the u.s. You know, india is now seeing more cases per day than any country has seen worldwide during the whole pandemic at over You know 300,000 a day right now and it's um, you know, it doesn't seem to be letting up And we're now questioning whether it's testing. That's the limiting factor in terms of reporting on these cases So it's it's pretty nasty now.

There's a famous indian politician who Who had been double vaxed? Who claims that he is covet positive as is his mother and sister and so it's also creating a little bit of a concern in the market about You know getting covet now. He doesn't seem to be having a severe case Um, which is you know, one of the kind of important things to take note of in vaccination is it's not necessarily binary Um, but it's certainly making a lot of creating a lot of fear as a result of his kind of public statement about this This isn't just about cases either 30 days ago they were at 200 deaths a day and uh, I mean tragically they're at 2100 So it's 10x in 30 days if it 10x is again, that's 20,000 people a day dying This is a different level than any other country has experienced tragic and they don't look at the end at the end of the day I don't have the the hospitals hospitals to handle this.

Do they this could become a crisis of epic proportions At the end of the day a country's success in battling covid's gonna be about how fast they can get their population vaccinated It's very simple, right? I mean israel was first they got everyone vaccinated now their cases are Down to almost nothing the u.s. Is doing pretty well, although there's some room for concern We were doing, you know, close to four million vaccinations a day now. We're at like three three and a half They're starting to slip a little bit Um, and that doesn't have to do with johnson and johnson, right that has to do with people not showing up for appointments Yeah, and I think you got to blame the media a little bit because they keep running all these vaccine scare stories about You know how this person or that person the vaccine punched through and they got sick to spike getting the vaccine They keep selling they keep selling all this like, you know covid Scary and porn, you know the fear right? Do you know what I noticed the other day on cnn? This is how insincere and Ratings desperate they are when they put up their covid stats.

They put up cumulative cases and cumulative deaths That's what they obsess on and it's like hey dummies. We know what you're doing here. You're trying to scare people You should show the graph of the deaths going down And then why can't you take your mask off if you're vaccinated and you're outside? Let's give a reward you were talking about this last week. Yeah, Nate silver had a really good tweet about this He said that wearing a mask after you're vaccinated is now it's like the the blue equivalent of the red maga hat Where it's completely performative to say hey, I'm on team blue You know, even though like scientifically it's meaningless.

I it's like the press they keep talking about this possibility That even after you're vaccinated and you could somehow, you know, try to keep transmitting the virus to other people Look viruses. I mean free birkenings is better than me, but viruses do not Have in themselves the machinery for replication, right? They have to take over your cells Hijack your cells machinery to replicate themselves. So first they have to infect somebody Then that person gets you know gets the virus starts producing a lot of it Then they start shedding it if you don't get really sick You're not going to be shedding a lot of the virus You're not going to be transmitting it to a lot of other people and you know, they talk about this this possibility As if it's like a real possibility that people could still be transmitting the virus after they're vaccinated I mean, it's not a statistically relevant possibility Right.

It comes down to this interpretation of everything being binary and the reality is that all of this is on, um, you know A statistical curve or on a kind of a gray scale And you know the sacks's point is a hundred percent correct that the probability of someone who's been double vaccinated Getting infectious getting infected and then being infectious in a meaningful way is so remote That it is not even worth kind of considering Uh, in a way and and being double vaccinated gives you such a significant typically right not for everyone Right all immune systems are different and some of what we might be seeing is the difference in kind of how people develop immunity Um, but it is such a rare case that one could have a severe infection After getting a you know a vaccination Um, it's such that it it shouldn't even be considered and kind of you know Mentioned as being a reason for continuing to wear masks and not gather and not do things And so you know, we started out as sacks pointed out and I think this is such a true and important point We started out with this like immediate Politis politicization of what's the right thing to do to reduce the spread of the virus And then that became the mainstay for that political affiliation And now the transition of the new world that we live in where most people are vaccinated We have a better understanding of the science and the statistics and the mechanisms of transmission We hold on and we grasp on To that initiating kind of belief system that was correct at the time But isn't correct anymore and it seems so difficult to get people to shift their mind this kind of This behavior is an ignorant behavior and you see it in so many manifestations Right now in particular with respect to masks and behavior after vaccination and so on And it's it's really brutal to watch.

Um, but we obviously digress a bit from the indian uh, circum the india circumstance, which is Uh, a really nasty one. So it looks like why why now and not a year ago, you know, it's it's not clear, right? So there's um, someone Provided a indication today that there may be as many as somewhere between 100 and 200 unique variants that that we're seeing emerge in india So there may be a a lot of interesting variant interesting technically but not obviously for human life, but a lot a lot of dramatic Um variants or significant variants that might be increasing the the infectiousness right now um, and uh, and in particular Uh, you know behavior has shifted in a way that's enabling, you know, some of these transmissions to occur You know, a lot of people let their guard down and so on in a way that maybe they weren't six months ago um, and uh, you know, there may be some forced evolution associated with partial vaccination Totally a theory right now where you know, 110 million doses have been given in india so far So, you know in order for a virus to succeed the viral variants that are going to infect more likely You know through a partially transmit a partially vaccinated population are the ones that are winning out So there's a lot of you know confounding factors here.

We're not really sure Um, but it is it is pretty brutal Um, what is what is going on? I will say like this notion that vaccination does not prevent Uh protection against variants is not a binary statement either. This is really really important I've been wanting to say this for a couple of our shows When you get this vaccine, um, what you're doing is you're training yourselves You're giving yourselves the RNA to print the spike protein and that protein is now in your body Everyone's immune system then reacts differently to create antibodies to that protein the antibodies that chymoth makes and jason makes And sacks makes and i make are all going to be different But if you had to pick whose would be better, I mean you probably just fell with mine I could tell you sacks is probably going to be a war talk, but jason's are the most sluggish for sure They're the slowest Yeah, but there there are there are likely tens of thousands of novel variants that our B cells will make that will That will bind to that spike protein and get rid of it And we will each have many hundreds or potentially thousands of novel antibodies that our immune system will make so keep that in mind You now have a portfolio of antibodies that your body is producing to that spike protein So now when when a when a covet when a SARS CoV2 virus shows up in your body Some of those proteins some of those antibodies are going to be really effective at getting rid of it Some of them are not Now the protein in the SARS CoV2 virus changes slightly Some of the other antibodies you have are going to be effective and some of the other ones are not And it is that portfolio that is um that is going to change Sorry that that portfolio that is going to define Your success at fighting off a specific variant of SARS CoV2 Where the spike protein is changing slightly with each variant right so these variants change the composition of the protein The antibodies that you have are going to be you know more or less successful depending on how that variant changes And that's um where there may be cases where the number of antibodies that you are producing or the success of the antibodies that you particularly have Are a little bit lower for a particularly new variant It doesn't mean that you're going to have an infection that's going to be a runaway infection in your body It means that it might take you longer Or it might be a little bit harder for you to clear that particular variant given the repertoire of antibodies that you've produced And that's why this isn't that's why this isn't binary right? It could be that it's like hey This variant shows up boom instantly.

I got rid of it. I don't have any infection But someone else might have like you know, maybe a slight bit of um You know, there might be a couple days where they'll feel a cold as your body's clearing it out And the measure of this is this um this neutralizing titer, which is the where they take people's Blood with all of their antibodies in it and they put these different variants in and they can measure how effective your antibodies are getting rid of that new variant Um and the the less effective your antibodies are the higher this this this titer needs to be And as a result it could be a little bit longer a little bit harder for you to get rid of that that virus and so So again like when viral variants start to emerge in the population and as they kind of take off And become more dominant it doesn't mean that we don't have immunity It means that immunity might be slightly affected Um, but not it's not one or zero right because you've got hundreds or thousands of antibodies to fight against covid In your body and I think that's really important So we should you know while there may be some variants that might be what we call variants of concern Meaning they can kind of slip away a little bit from most of the antibodies you have It doesn't mean you're not going to be able to fight them off with the antibodies And so I don't know if that was too technical or too difficult to understand No, I think it's really important makes total sense.

Yeah, yeah, and and And one thing just to add to that is is that most of the variants that the press keeps reporting with alarm that are somehow that that basically are going to be Vaccine proof they turn out not to be you know, that we they're Very shortly, uh, there there comes out a new article basically saying that the vaccines work And so the press keeps reporting these isolated cases as proof of something that's not actually true Yeah, I mean this is I just want to give the press a kind of I just want to again accounting for the press in the last 30 days one Obsessing about every single shooting And then inspiring more shootings when you obsess about these mass shootings you inspire more of them It is a proven fact.

It is inducing people to do this more. It's not exactly Correlated but there is proof about this same thing with suicides. That's why we don't cover any young people killing themselves in the bay area In a certain town that we all know had a rash of them or we don't cover Suicides on the golden gate bridge anymore because when they used to cover them and put it on the cover of the chronicle Two more people would jump off the next week. Number two. They were obsessing about riots I mean, I don't know if you turned on the tv during the deliberations.

They were absolutely Fulfill about the potential Of trouble happening and that of course incents more people to go out and see what's going on because you're going to get on tv And because other people are doing it and humans model other humans and then finally with the goddamn johnson and johnson Eight people have blood cuts. Nobody died. Am I correct in that and the one person died one person died Okay, so we don't even know and then they obsess about that for days Like you can't cover these things wall to wall and not Think that they you don't have culpability the cnn's the foxes, etc You're obsessing over these things and it's scaring people to not take vaccines It's incenting people who are crazy your dog whistling crazy people to go get a gun and to use that as a way to get famous and You're doing the same thing, you know with the with these You know riots in the streets.

We're all in the opinion business Um That's but but the problem is when they just when they don't just hype things But they actually give you factually incorrect information because you know, it's they're trying to scare people into getting higher ratings You know fear porn. It's also framing david, which is a different thing than lying about statistics. They would say we're not lying about the statistics That's how many people died of covet But what they're doing is they're framing the cumulative number to make your scare today 400,000 people have died from coveted It's like no over 14 months 400 people that have covered 700 people died today And that's the lowest number since november, but that wouldn't get more people to tune in boys.

I want to tell you guys something It's frustrating. Yeah I'm vaccinated I want to I want to see you I want to hug you keep a shirt on and it's uh, it's 5 30 p.m. And I've been uh working since 5 a.m. This morning Oh, is that what that look is? I I came back from Easter vacation guys and I had been up between either at 5 a.m. Or 6 a.m. Every fucking morning. You're working hard. You're working hard. I am grinding, but I am tired All right, let's wrap here when we as we wrap what what's going on just because people have been asking What's going on with the sec and spax and and just some more reporting or something because I was watching cmbc And they said hey, you're doing everything right, but there's a lot of other people doing things wrong Explain to us what's going on.

It's I mean, it's a it's a very specific Accounting issue which is that some spax many spax and in fact many companies let's just put it that way not just spax but many companies use warrants and the prevailing guidance on certain warrants was that they were equity and Basically that gets put into a balance sheet statement where you have equities assets and liabilities and you know, it sits on one side And basically what they said was they issued some refined guidance that said actually in these specific cases These should be really listed as liabilities. So then it needs to move from this column to that column but When that when you do that you go through, you know a bunch of cascading implications and effects and You know revisions and restatements.

And so that's what the that's what the entire securities industry is dealing with right now Which was You know this guidance by the sec and the implications. So that was on the 12th I mean just so you know today we just filed the updated All of our updated docs plus the updated s4 for so far So we were able to work around the clock and just kind of get it done and hopefully what we've also done is create a A bit of a way forward and a path that other folks can use to kind of like accelerate their their progress But it's definitely created a ton of work But uh, but we're I think we're I think we found the right answer Ultimately good for you because you want to see it buttoned up, right? Yeah, and and also I think like the simpler path forward So I mean if you just think about capital market stability for a moment like warrant coverage should probably go away number one Right.

So take all the warrants to zero Second thing that should happen is that uh, you know, I think this is an opportunity to take a step back and figure out How to really make sure that the SPAC sponsors are of the highest quality. Somebody told me this incredible thing today I am one of five groups that put up any money when we do a pipe in our deals in our deals Meaning he said to me 95 of sponsors put up literally a zero dollar game Zero and so of course you're going to have you know, extremely loose underwriting requirements If that's the case and so, you know, the idea that I'm thinking about Which someone proposed to me, which I think is very clever is this idea that you know, you earn more of the promote Uh more money you put up, right? So for example, like, you know, um, you know in in so far I think we put in 275 million dollars Um, so I mean we really you know, um, that's a meaningful commitment and It closes the gap between, you know, what your equity is issued at and what investors are buying at and that's very healthy Right.

And so I think there's all these mechanisms that will Clean up the SPAC market. We need to have a much More refined criteria to allow people to be sponsors Um, and we need to make sponsors in a position where they must put in money So that they actually do the work if you get something for free Let's be honest. You won't do the work if you're forced to write a check So you're gonna really think about it show me an incentive. I'll show the outcome and this happened on angel list Where in the beginning days of angel list, you had some angels quote unquote who didn't have any money So they put a thousand or two thousand into a deal Then they would have 500,000 come behind them and so you had this 500 to 1 ratio Of dollars to skin in the game and it was like well, why wouldn't A syndicate lead put every company out there and not even put, you know, they have no skin Which is why when you have a venture fund, I don't know what they expect this to put in typically Well, the problem is venture funds are 1 to 2 percent.

I was 25 percent Well, 1 to 2 percent is it can be pretty significant if you're doing a fund every three years I'm doing this and it's it winds up being millions of dollars for me But I'm happy to do it because I believe in my own ability All right, as we wrap anybody have a plug or anything they want to let people know about Oh, I I want to talk about this one little thing. I just not to talk about it But I would like to tell you guys to read it because it is so interesting Basically like European soccer tried to incite a revolt where like the top teams across all the different leagues Came together to try to create a super league But it ended up like they were like a band of evil villains and like fans erupted everybody erupted and then you know It existed for 24 hours, but in that 24 hours It looked like a complete rewriting of sports and sports like Laws and you know, um, it was an incredible thing.

There's an article in the New York Times. I'll post it in here and uh Folks want to read it. It's really really fucking funny and that will be on season two of Ted Lasso I don't know if you guys watched tim cooks um keynote this week with the new i max which are really beautiful He was so excited about Ted Lasso and Ted Lasso is a great show But I mean it literally is the the apple show anybody you guys see Ted Lasso yet What is it this television show you guys haven't seen Ted Lasso the tv show yet? Is it on mbc or cbs here? What channel is it on tv plus whatever that is? Channel six is it on channel six tv plus you got to go on your apple tv and then find an apple tv plus on your tv And you'll find it eventually it's it's one of their paid, you know, they have their own netflix competitor called apple tv plus So on your phone if you type apple tv, you'll have apple tv like the device i have apple tv's i have apple tv's behind my tv No, no, but there's apple tv plus which is their netflix.

So there's a better. Is it a better apple tv? No, no No, it's content. It's a content subscription you could have they just they screwed that part up Hey shout out. I just wanted to get uh, sorry. So who's who's Ted lasso? Ted lasso is a Jason sedacus comedy that is incredibly heartwarming about A really heartwarming joyful kind person who goes from america to the uk to become a soccer coach Yeah, that's really great. Yeah, I hate that's boring. That's really kind You would hate it. David is not cynical. I do. I hate it You should watch you should watch you should watch gamora on hbo.

Oh, I started it. Yeah, whoo, fuck Italian yeah, I got to the I watched the first episode. I was like, whoa, here we go It is so super and also you should watch it in the original language because it's not really italian it's like neapolitan and so like You know, I can catch and understand maybe 20 of the words and I said to that I said What language is it? She's like, I had no idea. I watched it in italian subsidles So it was it was beautiful. It's beautiful beautiful. It's so intense. It's like the wire, but like I mean, you know Set in italy.

It's incredible After life is also good ricky gervais. If you want something cynical and heartwarming. That's for you sacks. Love you guys Love you sacks. I'll see you Can you just come back to the bay area so we can play poker? Yeah Come back Why don't you just go on the way back? Why don't we go to Miami? Are we going to Miami? I'm going to I'm going on a trip. I'll just leave it at that. I'll talk to you guys in the vlog I'm going on a reconnaissance trip What? Recognizance Yeah, reconnaissance I'm going to be able to understand what's going on Do you understand that that that term is more associated with bail and in jail than it is what you think it beats? You are released like Jason you are released on your own reconnaissance.

That's what I'm talking about. You want to do reconnaissance reconnaissance, that's what I said reconnaissance Yeah, I think you'll be wearing an ankle bracelet on your reconnaissance Actually, no, they don't fit on his ankles To make it a good episode For Jason, it'll be a cankel bracelet Yeah, like you just can't talk Mr. Doughboy. What are you talking about? My god, what? Do you, is it called the bracelet if you're a calf and you're an anchor or the same? Put it this way, if sacks, sacks is wearing two of them right now, you'd never know Sacks is wearing one of those What happened to your neck sacks? We're out, we're out We're out, we're out See you, see you Love you guys, love you Bye bye, we'll see you all next time I'm doing all this
