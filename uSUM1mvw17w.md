# E66: $FB's big drop, Rogan/Spotify mess, Xi/Putin meetup & supply chain issues with Ryan Petersen

Date: 02/04/2022

Duration: 1 hours, 38 minutes, 56 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

The fact that Saks his greatest moment in life was beating Peter Tiel in a multi game chess. You ever see that picture of, yeah, of him with his arms raised and can't believe he beat. I mean, tell us about that moment. Nick, show that picture of Saks. I mean, listen, here's what I say. When I saw when I saw that picture, I had a couple of thoughts. Number one, I've seen this picture somewhere else. And then number two is, oh, my God, it was on NBC's to catch a predator. I mean, I have never seen Saks happier.

I like the birth of his children. Oh, my God. Pals in comparison to this moment. I'll tell you, that was the day of PayPal's IPO. And so we did a party in the, it was like a keg party in the parking lot. That was the extent of the celebration. And Peter did a 10 game. Did you rule off? Yeah. He did a 10 game simultaneous, which means he's playing against 10 people at the same time. And he goes board to board and makes his move. And I was the only one out of the 10 that beat him.

And somebody, I guess I put money. I put money down. I put like 20 bucks down or something on the game, which is a foolish thing to do against Peter because he's like a chess master. And, uh, and I somehow I won. And you can see I've got the money in my hands raised up. Look at the look on Peter Teal's face. He hates losing. Look at the look on. I mean, he's so angry. He, and he, but he's sees the joy in your face and he can't process it. And look at Max, Max's to my right and rule off his right left and there.

So pure joy. Yeah. But this was a few seconds before Peter smashed all the pieces off the board. And, uh, yeah, he flipped the board. He always does that when he loses. And, uh, his motto is when you call him a sort of loser, he says, show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser. Wow. Such a great line. But I just want to also comment on the pleats on Sax's pants and how high that was. That wasted and the cell phone holster and the cell phone holster. Oh my God. Zoom in on the cell phone.

Is that a blackberry? It just keeps. It's a blackberry. This is free iPhone guys. This is like, I mean, this is like 90s fashion. The gift that keeps on giving. I do have to say rule off's hair game. I mean, strong hair. Roll off's always had incredible hair. His hair is incredibly thick. He's great hair to this day. He's incredible thick. Yeah, it's still thick. Like thick. Beautiful hair. Never noticed. Let your winners ride. Rainman David Sax. And it said we open sources to the fans and they've just gone crazy. Love you guys. I'm Queen of Kinloft.

I'm going all in. All right, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the All In podcast with us again today, the dictator Tramoth Polyhapitia, Rainman David Sax and the Sultan of Science, formerly known as the Queen of Kinloft. He's out of that business. David Friedberg. We got a lot on the agenda. However, one thing that we've had a hard time figuring out is the state of the supply chain. And it's confounding. It seems like nobody knows what the hell they're doing. But there's one guy who's been on Twitter and we happen to know him. He's been on my pod and Friedberg knows him.

And his name is Ryan Peterson. And he's a bit of an expert on this. And we thought we'd have a bestie guestie come on. We don't do this too often. Maybe it's the third or fourth bestie guestie. And welcome to the pod, Ryan Peterson from Flexport. What's up guys? Thanks for having me on. What's up, Ryan? Ryan, did you tell Olivia you were doing the show today? No, I didn't tell her. So she's got a huge thing. Don't tell her? Where is she right now? Is she like not there? She was in the room next door, but I told her to leave me alone.

I'm doing a podcast. She knows I'm doing a podcast. She doesn't know which one. That's awesome. She's a super fan. She's a very big fan. She's literally wearing the Wet Your Beaks hoodie right now. It's awesome. Fantastic. My coincidence. She doesn't know I'm on the show. Fantastic. So what you're not going to tell her, right? She's just going to watch the next show and you're going to be on it? We'll listen to it. Yeah, we'll probably listen to it together tonight whenever it comes out. Ryan, what is the state now? Should we be worried about the supply chain? Is it getting better? Is it getting worse? What's 2022 going to look like? Yeah.

I mean, I think the supply chain means a lot of things in a little bit of what your industry is, what's really happening. But it goes for everything from manufacturing products, which means sourcing all the subcomponents, like semiconductors, through logistics and final delivery all the way to a customer store. And Reflexware focuses on that as sort of picking goods up from factories around the world and delivering them into fulfillment centers all over the world. So kind of that global mile is what we sometimes call it. There you're seeing real disruption. It starts really with the pandemic shifting consumer behavior where people started buying more goods because they couldn't go to restaurants and traveling things.

And so a lot of spend shifted onto goods and imports are up almost 20% imported container volumes. So that's the start of it all. And then what we learned is our infrastructure is dilapidated and unable to handle a 20% increase. And that's the infrastructure. I mean, the number of ships in the world, the capacity of throughput of the ports, the number of trucks and availability of trucks and chassis, which is the trailers that haul containers around. We just didn't have enough of these things or the port capacity. Look at American ports operate. I just learned the statistic pretty recently and I keep saying it because it appalls me.

Our ports operate with a lower throughput and productivity level than Mombasa, Kenya. We just do not have modern port infrastructure. Rotterdam's been fully automated for 20 years. So if they want to run 24 seven and keep containers flowing through the port, they can do that with self driving trucks and everything. Is that a technology issue or do you think that's a regulatory capture and union issue? Like a labor issue, like a labor. The tech is there. It's existed for a long, long time. It's really about labor, getting together with management, negotiating these things and allowing it to happen.

And the way that our ports are run is it's pretty crazy when you look at it, they treat labor as a fungible commodity. As in the port terminal operators will say, I need this many workers tomorrow and the union provisions that many workers, but there's different people every day doing operating complex heavy machinery that you can't like the number one thing in business is like, what did we learn today and how are we going to do better tomorrow every day with your team? So if it's a new team every day, like that's not even possible.

So I don't know how you can drive a productivity improvement when it's different workers every single day of the week. Right. So wait, they're not full time employees. They're like staff by the hour. Their union workers are paid by they have annual contracts. The union decide who goes to work every day and who gets shifts. Yeah. And where and so they'll show up different terminals and there's like 15 different terminals. So they just kind of move around to different jobs. So it's essentially what we saw it on the waterfront where like the union decides you get to work today.

These other people didn't, whatever. It's like literally like that movie. Yeah. It's literally like that. Even going further back in supply chains to manufacturing centers, how much are you hearing about and seeing kind of labor shortages because people are out for COVID and hey, someone's sick. They got to take 10 days off and when, you know, 10% of the employees get sick and they lose 10 days of work, the facility sees a decline in productivity to, you know, 70, 80% of normal. And then, you know, all of the output of that facility goes way down.

I mean, are you hearing about more of that stuff happening particularly during this kind of Omicron wave where the real effect of that hasn't really hit the supply chain system yet and we're still kind of seeing a buildup of, you know, of demand and we don't, you know, we haven't really kind of hit the problems. So for the last 18 months, China had this total zero tolerance policy and was very successful in keeping COVID out of their country. And so manufacturing just kept running as if no problem in China, which is the majority of this manufacturing.

With Omicron, you're starting to see that it is still taking hold in a zero tolerance policy. We haven't yet seen like major shutdowns and waves of shutdowns, but a little bit, you're seeing that here and there. The zero tolerance policy has shown up, for example, at least twice where one long, one port worker in a Chinese port got COVID and they shut the whole port down for like three weeks. Yeah, that's crazy. Which is really extreme. I mean, US workers have been getting COVID nonstop and the ports keep operating, even that, you know, we have lower level of productivity, but they'll shut the whole port down.

That happened both at Yantian, which is the largest port in China or second largest, and Ningbo, which is the third largest. So it's been very, very disruptive. It's also happened at the airports over there. So that's something I'm definitely keeping an eye on here over the next couple of months or even next couple of weeks. Are we still having this like we're ordering too many goods and we're backed up or is it that we're backed up for six months just trying to fulfill all those pandemic orders? Like what's the state of the backlog today if you could describe it? So volumes are high, but they're sort of flat.

They're over year over year, they're flat now. They're much higher than pre pandemic, but they're pretty much flat year over year. And that's what has me so worried here is that you have increasing delays, even though the inputs the same. Right. So the complex system where the same amount of inputs coming in, but the delays getting longer and longer, that's a very worrisome sign. Like if you're ever building a technology system, you're building this system and you're sending the same amount of bits in and the performing the job is taking longer and longer, that should be like that would be a very alarming sign that you're going to want to send some of your best engineers in here to debug today.

But I think we're seeing that like because a lot of companies people don't realize like when they buy capital equipment, like machines that are either sold to end users or buy their machines that are used in their own production systems. Capital equipment is typically assembled last minute. It's not like, you know, there are companies that own huge pieces of equipment and then they ship them and they just get plugged in and turned on. There's usually components associated with them. And you know, in businesses I've been involved in over the last couple of years, we've got a lot of lab businesses and hardware businesses.

And just getting capital equipment has been like delays like we've never seen. It's like, you know, a year to a year and a half or something that used to take four to six weeks to arrive because the company that makes that equipment is having delays with each of their component suppliers. And then all of this stuff backs up into the system and it plays out where the end user is now stuck waiting a year, year and a half and the business doesn't make progress. And a lot of hardware companies in Silicon Valley right now are facing these significant shortages where they can't get the equipment they need to ship product to their customers and they're sitting around burning money every month.

And so the result will actually show up down the road when all of a sudden they misrevenueed three, four quarters down the road. And that's why I've been saying for, you know, a couple of shows now that the biggest thing I'm concerned about is when the revenue shortfalls start to hit the companies that are dependent on these supply chains, but you don't actually see the revenue shortfall for a couple of quarters after the supply chain problems hit them. And just this quarter with the quarterly earnings we're now seeing, there's a company yesterday that reported called Ingredion, their big food ingredients company.

And they just reported how supply chain problems have now backed up to effect. And the stock was down like 10, 11% yesterday. And this is like a very stable, very mature third largest producer of starch in the United States and their business got totally hammered, but it took a while before that hit them. And so, you know, it feels to me, Ryan, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but like a lot of the business level and market level risk isn't going to show up for a while after these supply chain problems really persist within their organization.

This is the thing that has me most concerned is what's happened is it's now taking a 115 days on average across our customer base from when the factory says, hey, these goods are ready, come pick them up to when they finally get delivered to a warehouse in the United States. It's 115 days before the pandemic that was 50 and 50 evens felt high. Like the ship is only taking 15 days. Like what the heck is going on? Lot of inefficiency, a lot of customs processing, hard to find a truck, et cetera, even in normal times.

And you go to 115, all of a sudden these companies are so much less agile, like because you've placed the orders and you're expecting, forecasting demand is so hard. And now you're forecasting demand for twice as long of a time period. You've already placed all that inventory. If your demand goes down, guess what? You've already ordered the goods. So I'm really worried that we're going to find out in six months or in some time period in the future here that people have ordered way too many goods, that these companies expected demand to stay high and keep booming.

At some point, consumers start going to restaurants and start traveling a lot more. You get pre COVID consumption patterns and all these companies get stuck with way too much inventory that they paid way too much to ship and get delivered and they can't sell it. And so I'd be very worried for like middle market kind of retail, direct to consumer ecom, these types of businesses that aren't very sophisticated in demand planning and end up with way too much inventory. I think that there's been this weird dispersion actually. And I think that like these supply chain issues are not broadly distributed.

So if you bear with me for a second, if you watch the earnings reports, I don't know how close you watched them Ryan this past couple of weeks, but like Apple and Tesla basically said, it's kind of reasonably well managed, particularly on the chip side. And we see the whole thing easing Q4 Q1 of next year. Amazon last night basically said, yeah, there's some toughness in the system, but we think it's sort of like, you know, reasonably achievable and they're past it. And so it seems like the bigger companies who have influence were able to manage through it, the smaller companies to your point, who really do rely on many actors in the supply chain have been really thrown left and right that they probably don't know where demand really is.

So is that sort of the more nuanced actual the way that it's running out? Yeah. And it's sort of, it's very interesting to see this flip. So pre pandemic, the biggest companies paid the least for freight because they buy the most freight. So they negotiate good rates. Now they're paying the most and the biggest companies for a reason, they have the best businesses. They either have the best margins, the best, you know, they just built something that people wanted scale to be huge. Well, when times are tough and you need to spend extra to prioritize your freight to get loaded, to sign a contract and make sure that these ship owners and airlines honor their commitments and serve up.

It's the big companies that can afford it. And so they're not paying extra for freight, but they're getting around these problems. And freight is a really interesting market because it's pretty inelastic. Like you either going to ship the thing or you're not, whatever the price is, you're probably still shipping it. And so like, you haven't ever looked at an Apple at this level, but I'm sure that if you did, you'd see that it's a, the percent they spend on freight is just negligible. So if they doubled it, it wouldn't matter. But to Chimaz's point, it seems like, and I think we're seeing this a lot, the bigger companies can actually afford to integrate their supply chains.

Whereas before it didn't make sense to vertically integrate. Like I think Walmart announced that they've spent like $11 or $12 billion kind of rebuilding their supply chain themselves. Apple obviously has captive facilities all the way down to the FAB, where they're driving the whole supply chain from FAB to components. All these Foxconn facilities that are operated for them are captive facilities. But the Tesla obviously, you know, has a very deeply integrated supply chain team, whereas GM probably relied on subs who relied on subs who relied on subs. And that's why GM delivered like no electric cars, but Tesla was able to keep volume up.

The guys that are winning are the ones that are integrating supply chains. And do you think that that kind of becomes a persistent solution here where, you know, bigger companies, their competitive advantage becomes, Hey, we're going to own our whole supply chain all the way through. We're going to own more of the infrastructure all the way through, like Amazon's done with delivery vans and ultimately be able to kind of, you know, have a true competitive advantage because of this disruption that's going on right now. Yeah, potentially. I mean, I think my vision for Flexport is that we become that layer and we allow small businesses, medium sized businesses to get access to world class logistics services and get them a, you know, sort of almost be a union that can represent them at the table against these bigger guys.

I think it's very interesting to see a company's like the biggest companies have gone out and charter their own ships. Totally. Wild experiment to watch for my, I mean, I sit here with popcorn. They're bringing up a really important effect of all of this, which is what happens now in six or nine months to your point when the consumption of hard physical assets turns towards the consumption of services, which it typically does, right? If you revert back to the mean here, you know, people aren't going to be buying as many pelotons and all of that stuff because they bought them all, right? They bought all the physical goods they need.

And to your point, these companies have overordered all this inventory. Actually, Peloton is a perfect example because they basically shut down their entire supply chain last. At the end of this past quarter, and essentially said, our inventory turns will be more than enough to meet, you know, existing demand for the foreseeable future. That's an enormous capital problem that these companies now all of a sudden will face, right? So like the next step beyond all of the supply chain issues could be, and I think Sax has been talking about this a lot, like a pretty bad recession if these companies have all this inventory and they don't know how to get working capital.

Yeah, can be real ugly. And the other factor is the price has gone crazy. So the price of shipping and container long run, like I've been in this business and been a customer of this business for 20 years and you can just rule of thumb, it cost you $2,000 to ship a container from China to the West Coast. During 2016, that price collapsed. So you have these boom and bust cycles of an asset market. 2016, it was $550. Last year was $20,000. So it's up 10X over normal. It's up 40X or more right over just a few years ago.

And what that's done is create a real barrier to entry. Like for a DTIC eCom business, you used to be able to just go to China, find some product, put your label on it and go sell it on Amazon and you were in business. And there's like a huge number of people doing this. Right now, you have to come up, if you want to ship 10 containers, it used to be you needed 20 grand, now you need 200 grand. That's like, that's a real barrier to entry. So actually, I've talked to some companies in this space, we're really happy.

Like if you have an established business, you're like, great. Now it's much harder for Joe Shmo to show up in China and start competing with me. So I was really surprised to hear that. I thought that was like a pretty sophisticated take. What dollar point does air freight compete with containers? Because when we start hearing about chips, I was always wondering, and again, I'm no expert, but putting a bunch of chips on a plane versus putting them in a container, given how much those chips are valued by a Tesla, whoever's putting them into a car.

Isn't what was the breaking point? Certainly, but air freight prices just gone in line and it's gone up five X as well. And one thing to remember is that 50% of all the world's air freight flies in the belly of passenger planes, which should kind of horrify you if you're ever flying on a passenger plane from East Asia, but to the United States, there's probably a whole bunch of stuff down in that belly. And those are grounded. So the supply of air grounded. Why are they grounded? Because nobody's flying to China right now. Oh, I see.

So because there's no... Now, we're seeing kind of the backlog play into commodity cycles, right, Ryan? So we're seeing like a lot of these commodities because of these discontinuities in these supply chains, suddenly commodity prices are spiking all over the place. And I mean, do we think that settles down or do you think it kind of continues for the foreseeable future until this all works its way out? Yeah, I'm not the right person to ask about commodity prices. I know each of you on that, but on the logistics market, I don't see it sorting itself out for the next couple of years.

In fact, you've warned that it might get worse, right? I mean, I saw on Bloomberg, you said that there could be a union strike in maybe October. What are the prospects for that? And what happens if that takes place? So it's on July 1, the West Coast Union, it's called the ILWU. That union extends from the southern border, so from Mexico all the way to Alaska, and it includes Canada. So the whole West Coast of the United States is run by this one union at the ports. Their contract expires on July 1. And in years past, so the last time this happened was in 2015.

This is a contract that was signed then and extended at some point. But in 2015, they had a three month period where nobody could import anything on the West Coast and some major companies missed Christmas that year. So that's July 1. There's kind of slowdowns in the months leading up to that. And we've already had slowdowns for a couple of years with hundreds of ships are now waiting offshore. So yeah, I can't make a prediction. This is slowdown basically a negotiating tactic by the unions? In the past, it has been. I'm not convinced that that's what we've seen over the last year versus, you know, there are legitimate problems staffing, people getting COVID, et cetera.

So is there a role for presidential leadership in sorting out these union issues or just sorting out the issues with the port more generally or avoiding a strike in July? I mean, it seems to me that if Biden wants to get reelected, this inflation supply chain issues are pretty top of mind and in the news and are going to be on people's, you know, you want to be seen doing things. And I do think there are things that can be done. So yeah, there's a role. And as far as union negotiations, Biden's probably pretty as equipped as any president's ever been to negotiate with the union and get them to play nice and not screw up his reelection with a strike.

He's known as a union friendly president and goes sit down and do a deal with them where Trump would probably never be able to do a deal with the union because they know that there's sort of natural adversaries. So there's something there. There's a lot more to be done. And I got some arguments with people that are like, you know, that's not in the president's power to do such and such. I'm like, yeah, but he's the president of the United States to pick up the phone. Like you can do things that aren't legally in your power just by asking for favors and other people do them.

And you negotiate with unions. A good idea, a good example, convincing to change the zoning laws in LA so you can stack containers higher would be another. Yeah, that's not the president of the United States jurisdiction. But if he calls the mayor of LA or the city council, can you explain that? So what does that mean? So in Southern California, you can't stack a container more than too high in a truck yard by law. Well, we got no place to put these containers. But is that a danger issue or is that like a site issue, site lines? Like what? I said a little bit about it.

So I think there's some safety issues, although they're stacked six high all over the world. So that's not that legitimate to my, in my view. And in California, it's what, four or something? Two, too high. It's too hot. Oh, wow. At the truck yards, at the port, you see them stacked six high, but in the truck yards, two is the limit. Okay. And so it's, it's also an eyesore, especially in California, containers are a sign of free enterprise and it's just the people in California can't stand to see them. They really just object to the idea of capitalism in their neighborhoods like that.

But there could be like some kind of temporary waiver that we do just to get through all of this backlog, which is to say, okay, let's just ease all of these small little things that slow the process down just to get all these ships, you know, unloaded, right? Off into the world where they need to be. And then we could revert back to what we are after things, you know, kind of normalize. Yeah. So we did that. So like I wrote about this, this zoning law and what's happening then is if you can't stack the container three high, there's nowhere to put that third container.

So you leave it on the trailer and now you have one less trailer in rotation, servicing the port to unload. And that's true across Southern California right now. There are thousands of trailers with containers on them because they're not allowed to stack them, they'll get fined if they do. So I tweeted about this and the city of Long Beach actually responded. I tweeted about it at 6 a.m. by 3 p.m. the city of Long Beach had changed the zoning law to allow stacking up to five high, I believe. I'm told the fastest response by any government to citizen action like ever.

That's incredible. You must feel great about that. It was great, but unfortunately the only Long Beach that LA never followed through other and there's not that many truck yards in Long Beach, a lot of them are in Los Angeles, Compton, Rancho de Minguez, et cetera. So this is the kind of thing like, yeah, Joe Biden could call these mayors and say, hey, let's work on this, right? Yeah, but let's face it. He's super union Joe, right? Like I mean, he wouldn't even say the word Tesla over the union. No, but Jason, isn't that more pro union because won't these won't folks be working more and getting paid more? And I don't think there's a reluctance to pay, right? Because clearly like you're going to have to put some money into the system and where the money comes from, we can figure that out later.

But the point is that there should be a desire to actually get the people on the ground to be working. There wasn't even a third shift, Ryan, right? Like that was another thing you were working on top of the stacking of these containers to get more of these, to alleviate the problem. You were also talking about they don't even have a third shift some nights, but they seem to have added a third shift. Did that become permanent or not? No, they do have a third shift, but nobody's showing up is the problem. So truck drivers don't work in the middle of the night, warehouses aren't open in the middle of the night.

Is that a compensation issue, Ryan? Like if we paid more, would folks show up? Like is that just a supply demand issue that needs to get sort of that? Maybe, maybe, maybe, never underestimate incentives. There's just a lot of factors and a lot of it is, it's so easy to point fingers at somebody else and blame someone in the chain, right? Supply chain. You've got all these different people and it's everybody has their own opinion. You know, we, at one point I wanted to hear what the union's opinion was. What are they saying? Because everyone else is calling them lazy and not working hard.

What's really happening? I said to Taco Truck down to the port a couple of months ago just because I figured we'd get them free tacos, they'll talk to us and that works. That's a game changer right there, yeah. That really works. So we, well, we got, they loved it. They said we're the only business ever to send tacos to the port. And then they told us all about what their viewpoint was. They viewed that the truckers are screwing up, that 50% of all the appointments where a truck is supposed to come and pick up a container, they're missing their appointments.

Right. And because, and then, and then so that's what sent me investigating, wait, why are they missing the appointments? That's when I learned, oh, they don't have any trailers, these chassis's because they're stuck under containers and can't be unlocked. So a lot of it is going here. The supply chain is kind of like this, that metaphorical elephant in the dark room, right? And everybody sees their own aspect of it, but you got to synthesize all those perspectives and kind of take a systems view and see if you can get some real understanding. I'm not convinced I have it yet, by the way.

I think it is more complex and I'm really be aware of simple narratives. If someone, even including me, says, oh, this is exactly what's happening, like, there's really a lot of complexity in all of this. Brian, how much of this is sort of the extreme end of the other spectrum, which is basically the US exceptionalism view that says, okay, we just need to really in house more of the stuff that we need so that we don't actually have to rely on some of these arcane methods of just transporting goods from point A to point B? In my view, that would be a shame if we, I mean, we have the best companies in the world who need to be able to source raw materials, components, finished goods anywhere on planet Earth and we should have a modern infrastructure that makes that possible instead of being like, oh, we can't trade with the rest of the world.

So we're going to become like self sufficient. You know, we might as well go back to everybody being a farmer on subsistence farmer on our own land. Like, I think we should have global infrastructure that's really great and seamless and makes it really easy. And that's right, that might be an end result is people can't rely on these supply chains and starts saying, hey, let's manufacture at home or let's manufacture in Latin America, let's manufacture closer to home. To my perspective, that would be a shame. Well, I think the, I think the, the pendulum always starts from one extreme to the other.

And I think the, the middle ground is probably that you need to have some heterogeneity, right? You have to have some amount of it that is not just singularly reliant on China. Maybe it's, maybe it's to central or Latin America, right? Some that's domestic, but that domestic production probably has to be subsidized by something because we're never going to be able to run as efficiently and as cost effectively as, you know, cheaper international labor, you know, unless we invent something really, you know, incredible. So the balance is probably in the middle, but it's going to take us a long time to kind of get there.

I think I saw a governor Abbott was pitching people on, hey, just send your containers to Texas where cheaper and more central in the country. Is that true? Is that a solution? It takes much longer, costs much more. When if the union goes on strike on the West Coast, it'll be one of your only options bringing stuff through the canal. What you'll very quickly see is that the canal is going to back up. Can't move that many more ships through the canal that are currently going to the West Coast. So a lot, and you've seen that a lot where the bottleneck just moves for a while last summer, the, for example, the trains that were going into Chicago, they were really having a hard time staffing the railroads out there, and it was taking them a long time to unload containers at the port at the terminals inland in Chicago.

And drivers, a lot of the truck drivers are owner operators. So these are entrepreneurs who own their own truck work for themselves. And they were able pre pandemic to do three loads per day at the Chicago railheads go drop it off, come back at another one three times with the delays and the traffic jams that resulted. They were only able to do one a day. And so you opt out because you can go drive for UPS or FedEx or take your truck and do something else. So we had this huge reduction in drivers. And that's the kind of a feedback loop that we should all be really mindful of here, where a problem begets more problems and you get these positive feedback loops in the system that really vicious cycles.

And so, you know, bottlenecks move and you'll see as soon as they, if everybody started to ship to Houston, guess what? Houston port won't be able to handle the volumes either. It's not like it's magically better just because it's a Republican state or something. Do we need more ports or do we just need to run them more efficiently? And then who determines who runs the port? Because I know that they, I've seen some tweets of yours where they license the government, I guess, owns the ports, but they license it to people to have the franchise there.

More ports, better run ports. And then what's the business model of ports? I'd say better run ports is the answer. I don't think we need more ports. You can't really create ports out of thin air, like there's only a handful of geographic locations that actually make sense for a port. And we have, we have great geography, like the San Francisco Bay, like this is probably the best natural harbor in the world or one of them. And the Oakland ports perfectly fine. It's who owns it is the city of Oakland or the city of Long Beach, the city of LA.

So the local cities own the ports in the United States. That is a difference between United States and Europe, for example, where there's sort of national strategic assets. There's still government owned, but it can be operated as a sort of public good for everybody instead of what are the odds given what's going on in Oakland that that's the big priority of the mayor of Oakland to run a better port. Like she's got a lot of other things on her list. And so that's one problem with our system. And then second, they do rent it. So the government owns it and then rents it to a private company that operates it.

And then, but those as a condition of renting the port, you must agree to hire the ILWU. You can't run a nonunion port in the United States. Should the government buy the federal government buy the port from Oakland, buy the port from Long Beach, offer them some trillion dollars or billions of dollars and buy it out from them? It's not a terrible idea. I mean, as long as you're forcing everyone to use union labor, it's not really like a private sector endeavors. It's like you can't, especially with the way that the unions run. So you can't do that much.

But like here's an example where technology could flex what already made this technology. We could 10X the throughput of one of these ports overnight, which is today a truck driver shows up looking for a specific container. He's like, I got this container number. So they have to make an appointment at that hour. And as I said, they're missing 50% of their appointments. Well, on the back end inside the port, they got to go find that container in the needle in the haystack and make sure it's at the front during that one hour when the guy shows up for it.

And we already have this tech to make it what we call a free flow stack where you just have this, the truck pulls up and you give them the first container off the line and then the mobile app tells them where to take it. And he doesn't have to come for a specific container. And if you did that, you'd just be every 30 seconds coming out of here instead of every 10, 15 minutes, you'd easily 10X the throughput. And this is, we already have this tech. So it's a matter of implementation deployment and how do you get around a lot of people that don't really want to see better running ports.

And it's pretty sad to sit where I sit. They don't benefit from better running ports. That's the good point. Although at the back end, they suffer from higher prices and inefficiency and not getting the things they want on time. Well, if you listen to Elon talk about unions and why Tesla is not a union shop, it's got nothing to do with wages. He said, we'll pay you the union rate or better. And it's not about mistreatment because he said, listen, if someone mistreats you, we're going to have a no assholes rule and we'll get rid of them.

The issue is inflexibility. He wants to drive continuous process improvement at Tesla and he can't do that with a union shop because every change has to be negotiated. And then if there is a worker who's not living up to the performance bar, you can't get rid of them and they can't repurpose workers and have them work a different line. So that's why Elon has always resisted being a union shop, not the wages, not mistreatment, purely inflexibility. And it seems like that's what you're seeing in the ports as well is we can't drive changes and improvements because everything's so highly contractually negotiated.

That's my editorial comment. Ryan, what do you think about that? No, I mean, it's kind of, it's worth studying a little history here is that like, you know, we went through the container revolution in the 60s and 70s and the union agreed to it and they, that dramatically transformed the waterfront. These guys like, you see photographs from that era, they would put it on their back, like burlap sacks full of stuff, like hauling it on and off these, these ships and kind of load them by hand. It was a real art and it was a massive employment driver.

And by the way, we've still barely recovered from this. Like the West Side Highway in New York is finally like a nice park, but it sat there for 50 years, like dilapidated piers and ugly ass buildings. And some of those are still there. San Francisco Waterfront still mostly like that south of the Bay Bridge. It's still like these old dilapidated buildings. So it's kind of funny to see how long it takes like that infrastructure to change. But there was, and I don't know, I'm not like the world's expert on this history, but somehow they convinced the union to adopt containerization, which is about, it's far more radical than anything we would be proposing now in how you would change their workflow or change their work.

Like that was complete change where it's really these giant automated or these giant cranes that replace the worker. Couldn't Biden deploy his commerce secretary or, I mean, isn't there some cabinet official he could deputize to say, go solve this problem, go bring the parties together? Yeah. And I think I suspect that'll happen over the coming months because July 1st is pretty bad timing for a midterm election if they were to go on strike. And I think he's got a lot of incentive to make sure that doesn't go wrong. He does have the incentive. It just seems like, I mean, you've been tweeting about this for months that nobody's paying attention in the administration.

I mean, we've all been reading your tweet storm saying like someone in Washington really should be paying attention to these ideas. This spans over to administrations now, right, Ryan? Both administrations have been out to lunch on this. And the unions are really big issue that's going to come up this summer. It might be an even bigger issue that's got even less attention, which is on January 1st of next year, January 1st, 2023, which is tomorrow in shipping terms, that all the ships in the world will have to reduce their carbon emissions by 13%. And these are internal combustion engine.

It's not a great... Ryan, hold on a second. Wait, just explain what that means by who's mandating that and how is that enforceable and why is that have to... It's the international maritime organization. It's part of the United Nations and it's the group that is overseeing global ocean freight. It's the regulatory body for ocean freight in the world. And it's the United Nations group. So any member state of the United Nations must follow the rules of the IMO and they've all said they will. And so the IMO has said all existing ships in the world must reduce their carbon emissions by 13%.

And again, it's an internal combustion engine. We don't know how to make it 13% more carbon efficient or we would have done that already. Can you actually buy indirect offsets? Can you go and buy some Amazonian rainforest credits and offset the... No, you can't offset it. And it's not about the fleet either. So some of these fleets have LNG, liquid, natural gas. So the fleet might be more efficient, but it's down to the individual ship. So there is one way to reduce the emissions of the ship and that's to go slower. And if you go 30% slower, then you can achieve a 13% reduction in carbon emissions.

If you look at it on a per container basis, by the way, it's the same amount of carbon emitted because the ship is still carrying the same number of containers, just go slower. But it will reduce the supply of shipping capacity and slow everything down another 30%. That takes place January 1st, 2023. It's getting very little attention, but to my view, it's going to be massively disruptive if we slow everything down, reduce the capacity of the network that much further, prices are going to go to the moon. And it's really asinine law because it doesn't actually achieve any carbon reduction.

The fuel type, correct me if I'm wrong, is this like MGOMDO? Like it's dirty or fuel? Is that correct? So the same group IMO actually passed a new law January 1st of 2020. And it got totally, it was supposed to be a huge deal in our industry and then COVID hit and we all kind of ignored it. But that eliminated the worst kinds of fuel, sulfur. It used to be, you could have this bunker fuel that was up to 3% sulfur. It's led to crazy amounts of sulfuric acid, which is like apparently like 15 times worse than carbon as a greenhouse gas.

So that was eliminated. And now it's still kind of ugly bunker fuel, but it's not like it used to be. The reputation is probably still carried over from pre 2020. If you could wave your magic wand as we wrap up here and change two or three things that to you seem like layups. And I think you kind of hinted at them. In order, what would be the changes just based on your intuition and your knowledge of the supply chain? What two or three things are the layups we got to do right now? I think first off, it's got to start with some, with metrics like what, if you care about something, measure it.

The metric that the government's been using for ocean freight delays has been how many ships are waiting offshore at the port of Long Beach. And this is like one of the most mischievous, I don't know if it was just like outright fraud or incompetence, but one of the worst things I've seen from a government in terms of PR is they, they passed this rule that the ships have to wait 150 miles offshore. So that the carb so that the pollution wouldn't hit LA like reasonable good. But then they kept using the same metric for how many ships are waiting right outside the port.

And, and, and it went way down and they started celebrating that success. So like, let's actually use the right metric, which is how long is it taking cargo to transport? You can't just hide the ships and celebrate that there's no ships there. So if we get the government, you're saying that the government pushed the ships beyond the measurement window and then said they don't exist? Yes. Basically, the transportation secretary and the port of LA director got up there, this government official. That's like when I went to an XL sweater to hide my gut and I was like, I'm thin.

Yeah. Look, better to look at the scale. So if we at least get them focused on the right metric, which I think we have the best metric right now, we call it the flexport ocean timeliness indicator. It's how long is it taking the cargo to from when the factory says it's ready to when it can be delivered. Now any solution that we create, we have a metric. We know. Okay. There's a KPI here door door. Yeah. Door to door. You mentioned the transportation secretary was part of that press conference where they're taking credit for changing the metric.

So I assume that's Buddha judge who's in charge of dispersing the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. Is there any money in the infrastructure bill to solve this problem? There's $17 billion allocated to ports. I went and read it and I couldn't find any money that was going to be spent on building ports. It was like, study this. So here's the crazy thing. We just had this trillion dollar infrastructure bill that's supposed to modernize and update the infrastructure of the country and it's doing nothing to solve the most pressing supply chain issue in the country, which is the bottleneck at the ports, which is driving inflation, which is causing interest rate increases and wrecking the economy.

There's a term in Washington, which is called the Christmas tree bill. And the infrastructure bill is an example of that, which is this is not a directed shot on goal. What this is is a random tree that you go and hang little things on top of. And eventually the whole thing is covered. So it kind of looks beautiful from afar. But when you get really close to it, it's a little bit chaotic and you don't understand what's going on. And so to your point, the fact that Ryan can say there's $17 billion allocated to something like ports, but it's unclear to him who's an expert in the space where that money goes and how it's spent gives us zero chance of figuring this out.

Yeah. I mean, it's like things like, oh, each state must create a supply chain readiness report about it's like, what are you talking about? Like Singapore put $20 billion to build a badass automated port. Like that's like a reasonable thing to do. Like let's spend $20 billion make the most automated amazing port in the world. That'd be a good use of government money. But like to then create studies and consultants, I don't know that any of it's going to hit the ground and shovel. Right. So you're saying that $17 billion that goes to studies and consultants could actually get redirected and we could pick a port where there's an amenable city and actually completely modernize it to set the example of what modern shipping should look like in the United States that at a minimum matches what's happening in the rest of the world.

Yeah. It's pretty awesome and doesn't seem to me like science fiction, like the government wants to build a port who's going to stop the government from building a port. That seems too logical and too obvious, Ryan. Well, we can have the ports compete for who gets to get that $20 billion to be the modernized port. Like Amazon held the competition. Well, if you put the put the put the mayors in competition and see which mayor wants us in their backyard. Does Greg Abbott want it? Does Long Beach want it? Does Oakland want it? Who wants to fight to be the most modern port? That should be.

DeSantis wants it. I'll tell you that. DeSantis Miami. Yeah, exactly. So, Greg Abbott wanted, I don't know that California's two incredible ports wanted. And those are the two that are closest to China, by the way, spoiler alert. You guys remember when Google Fiber ran that competition and they got like mayor Pittsburgh to swim in like a frozen lake and it was awesome. Yeah. Like government, yeah, please bring us stuff. So, yeah, I think I don't have a lot of faith. Even if that came around, it would take five, six years, right? Even if it was done right, you don't get a port overnight.

There are some very simple solutions like this changing the zoning law, adopting technology to go with a free flow out of the port, put some metrics in here, like have someone focus on this. A key part of problem solving is make sure the problem doesn't get worse. So, let's assign someone to go work with the union and the company terminal operators, make sure that they don't go on strike. Make sure, and then someone needs to go look at this IMO, UN thing and figure out if the United States is really going to go through with that because it's pretty crazy.

Well, listen, Ryan, you've been incredibly generous with your knowledge and your leadership watching you as a CEO and a leader go out there on a boat and go visit and buy the fricking tacos and actually boots on the ground, figure this out. Like the country owes you debt, the world owes you debt to really keep this problem down to first principles and figure it out. And our government should be taking notes. And really the other leaders who are importing, whether it's Apple or Tesla, it'd be great for all of them to be supporting you. I don't know if they've reached out, but maybe a half dozen of you can then sit with this administration and the next one and just tell them where to point the money cannon.

Well, we have a lot of... Because it doesn't seem like they know where to point it. We have a lot of people in Washington that listen to this pod. Please just reach out to Ryan. Just reach out to Ryan and have a go. Please just sit there and buy tacos for these important people. Let Ryan buy you a taco, guys. Ryan, bring your taco truck to Washington. One of the big common denominators of both business and politics is that leaders have to focus on the right problems. And when they're not focused on the right problems, bad things happen.

We know that inflation is a huge problem. The Fed now is raising rates or projecting raising rates very quickly, which is creating... It was created a huge market downturn. It's a very blunt instrument. It could cause a downturn or a recession. So that's the big problem. And yet there are specific solutions and fixes to the inflation problem by updating or modernizing the ports that Ryan suggested. But who's focusing on it? And now the problem is to go. And they'd be more strategic, right, Sacks? They'd be more strategic sniper shot as opposed to this blunt instrument like a chain.

Right, exactly. So, and so what have they been focusing in Washington on? Definitely not this, you know? Absolutely. And then I see Ryan post these suggestions on Twitter and then all these people come in and they're all like fatalistic, oh, well, the president can't do anything. Of course the president can. Emergency war time. There was ever a time for presidential leadership. This would be it. What I worry about is that if you're the union leader and you know that you've got Biden in the White House who's always going to take their side, why wouldn't you make your demands more unreasonable? Yeah, they should be asking for triple time to keep it open overnight.

Why wouldn't they? Do you really, if you're the leader of that union, do you believe that Biden's going to break your strike? No way. No way. Ask for quadruple time. Yeah, just make it painful. You should make the most of the crisis. Agree, just ask possible. I mean, this is your max leverage right now. Max leverage. Never waste the crisis. Yeah, this is your time. All right, man. Listen, Ryan, thanks a lot. Ryan, thanks. Appreciate it, man. Ryan, thanks. My pleasure. I'm a big fan of the show, so being a bestie guestie means a lot to me, so thanks to you.

Yeah, and we'll continue the discussion perhaps at the All In Summit in May. Exactly. See you in Miami. Facebook stock has dropped over 25% after reporting negative user growth for the first time and not only $10 billion or maybe even $12 billion lost a year on their AR, VR headsets and project, but also a $10 billion decrease in projected 2022 revenue thanks to Apple's privacy features. I guess we got to go to you first, Chamath. Well, also PayPal dropped 25% too. Yeah, we got the pay. And then Snapchat had a whipsaw back and forth. But Chamath, when you see this, you call this with your spread trade.

Maybe you could walk us through what you saw, whatever it was, three, four, five months ago, and then what you're seeing now. At this level, with $250 billion wiped off the market cap, what do you think about the future of this as a trade and as a company? Well, I think the trade did what it was supposed to do, which is in a period of a lot of volatility. I saw an opportunity to just reduce my risk exposure. Look, I'm generally long, very risky assets. All of us are in the business of building companies that have huge volatility because all of our companies generate earnings very far in the future.

And so in November of last year, I was trying to figure out what I could do to shield myself. And the reason I wanted to shield myself was because I saw Elon and Jeff in part selling. But also, I saw that clearly we were going to go through a period where that high growth tech was going to trade down. So I sold some of that high growth tech. But then I also wanted to figure out a way where I could be less exposed to some of that volatility by continuing to hold what I had. And the best way that I figured out how to do that was to do the spread trade.

And so what I saw at the time was that there is one business above all others that I think is immune amongst big tech from any sort of real long term issues. And that's Microsoft. And I think David expressed the reason well, is that it's an enterprise business now. Business generally don't tend to care about enterprise businesses. They have enormous longitudinal growth in front of them. And they're able to do things on the margins, specifically around M&A, to keep building their business with very little oversight. And we saw this because they had the courage to do this Activision deal just a few weeks ago.

If you could imagine, again, no other company in big tech could even dare try to do a $70 billion acquisition because of the scrutiny. In this climate, it was a bold move, yes. I think it's not a bold move. I actually think it says the obvious, which is Microsoft is beyond the level of regulatory scrutiny that the rest of big tech actually has because they are consumer businesses. The second safest company is Google. And the reason is that Google has the best of both worlds. They're both a platform because of Android. But then where they are at risk of being an app, they have an incredible deal with Apple that blunts that effect.

And so when Apple talks about all their push to privacy, you still have this very specific relationship and Facebook called it out in their earnings release. They said, we believe that Google has preferential treatment relative to the rest of the internet in that Apple deal because they pay Apple $15 or $20 billion a year. And for people who don't know, that's for search. The default search on your iPhone goes to Google. Google pays $15 billion to Apple and the acquisition, expand the acquisition there of why that would give them preferential in case people don't connect with the dots.

Well, if you're paying somebody $15 or $20 billion a year, they're less likely to do bad things to you. They may do bad things to other people, but they're not going to do as many bad things to you. Did you believe that? Yeah. That allegation from Zuck? Yeah. Well, no, I don't believe the allegation, but I think that general character, that general thing is true. Like you're not going to screw over your partners. You're going to screw over other people before you screw over your partners. Whether this applies here, it'll have to be borne out in some kind of lawsuit or state AGs or blah, blah, blah.

But anyways, I think the point is that every other company has a lot more headwinds than Microsoft and Google and Big Tech. And then the third thing is was a market observation from Gavin Baker, which I thought was incredibly brilliant. And what he said was when you see a drawdown, meaning when the markets go down, it'll affect high growth tech first. It ended up touching a bunch of other areas second, like biotech. But he said this key thing, which is Big Tech will be the last to crack, but when they do, they are going to get shot.

And so I spent a bunch of time just trying to figure out when Big Tech gets cracked, who's going to get cracked the hardest? And I just kind of wanted to create a spread between those who were the most inoculated to those that were the most at risk. As it turned out, Netflix puked it up, Facebook puked it up. Amazon actually got really crushed even though this past day they had a pretty decent rally because of their earnings, but they really got crushed. So in any event, the trade is what the trade is. The bigger thing is what is going on at Facebook.

And I think what you see are three really important headwinds that Facebook called out explicitly. One is that when they talked about usage kind of flattening and starting to decay, what they're really talking about is TikTok. And I think what we learned is that TikTok is an enormous threat and a huge competitive force now in the consumer social app ecosystem. The second is that Facebook is fundamentally an app that sits inside of an ecosystem that is subject to the rules of the platform owner, and that's Apple and Google. And so this IDFA change, so the change in how you can track advertisers, Facebook said it's going to have a $10 billion impact in 2022.

And then the third thing, which was more implicit, is in order for them to grow, if you can't grow organically, the only other way to grow is inorganically. And unfortunately, as we're seeing, the regulatory focus on this company is really enormous. And so it was a pretty watershed moment in, I think, that company's discussion of their future. And Mark actually kind of said that as much in the press. Yeah. Saks, you look at this business, you made an interesting observation. Facebook rebranding itself as Meta before Meta exists, it maybe looked at as another sort of sign that maybe they got a little tilted, maybe.

What was your take on the sort of changing the name of the company before that business really is at scale or exists? Yeah. I mean, it's a bubble move. Because look, when you're in an upmarket and the market is super frothy, we had in hindsight last year was a giant asset bubble funded by all this liquidity coming out of the Fed and the federal government. So yeah, in a bubble like that, all investors care about is the growth story. And so Facebook went all in on the story around Metaverse, but in the cold light of day, once the punch hole has been taken away and you're in the hangover and you're in sort of a very volatile potentially.

The DJ packed it in. Yeah, bear market. Investors go, wait a second. This VR division is losing 10 billion a year. It might even be 12, by the way, because they said it was a little higher. They lost 6 billion last year. They lost 10 billion this year. The losses are escalating. And so in that kind of market, investors are like, wait a second. Do I want to invest in a company whose future is that unclear? I mean, if you look at this market, we've seen that the growth stocks are down 60. Today's an update.

Yesterday was a horrible day. So they're bouncing around 60, 70% down off the highs in early November. But the fangs are only down like 14%, something like that. But Facebook basically took themselves out of the sort of the market leader bucket and put themselves in the growth bucket. They're like treat us like Peloton. We're speculative. Why would they want to do that? It was a terrible strategic decision you're saying. Well, it was a decision. It was the kind of decision where you look back with 2020 hindsight and you say, look, that kind of decision could only be made in a bubbly, frothy market.

You would never make that decision in the kind of down market you have today. And other decisions look stupid as well. So PayPal was just down 25%. Why was it down? Yeah. Well, no growth in users. It was mostly on the forecast. And yeah, they revised their forecast down considerably. And of course, they tried to blame it on the economy, but other companies, Amazon just had a huge beat relative expectations. They're up 15% today. So not everybody is blaming the macroeconomic picture the way that PayPal did any event. My point is you go back six months ago and what was PayPal doing? I wrote a story for Barry Weiss for her sub stack about how PayPal was taking the lead at financial deplatforming.

They were working with the ADL and the SPLC to kick, to identify groups to kick off their platform. So that's what management was spending their cycles on, figuring out how not to grow, how to kick people off their platform and trying to figure out how to get more people on it. Sounds familiar. Who else is trying to kick people off their platform? It's the kind of thing you do when you're in a frothy market and your stock is up and you're feeling triumphant. You can waste your management cycles on stuff like that. Now that their stock is down 25%, you have to wonder, gee, we wish we had spent our time on other things.

Okay. So, Friedberg, I have a question for you about the future. Obviously, Facebook has bet the farm on Meta. They're betting on VR and I guess eventually AR or what collectively is called XR. And then we have news that Apple has a seemingly brilliant goggles product coming out. Developers are getting into it and they are the masters of hardware. So now Zuckerberg has decided he will be on a collision course with the company that just took $10 billion in revenue from them by doing the non tracking. And that is the masters of hardware. So we have this collision course coming.

And then just two weeks ago, Google said, hey, by the way, remember that Google Glass thing, we're not giving up on VR, AR either. And of course, Microsoft, we all know, has their HoloLens. So when we look at that four horse race, if you were to bet and rank, who's going to win Apple, Goggles, Google Glass, whatever they're going to call the new thing, HoloLens and Meta's Oculus, who's going to win? And how do you look at that competition between the big four? I don't know if that's a race you want to be in. Okay.

I like that answer. Race to nowhere. Have you guys used the Oculus Quest device? Absolutely. I have two of them. Try, oh my. Have you played the games where you move continuously through space? And when you do that, it's like you're going to throw up. I'm not sure that this notion that that becomes the new computing modality is a fair and true notion. And so it may end up becoming kind of a niche entertainment device, almost like a Nintendo Switch where there's a mode when you're using it, but I'm not sure it replaces traditional static two dimensional computing in front of you.

The jury's still out. I don't see like a computer sentiment that says these things will ultimately kind of prevail over the current mode. So who's going to... If it does work, who would win in your mind? Who's got the best chance of winning? Let's assume we're all going to use it every day for two hours as our desktop. We're going to put it on. We're going to find workout apps to use, whatever it's going to become. Let's assume. Well, I think you just answered your own question. In all of these things, when you build hardware, I think you can take a lot of parallels from what happened in the PC space.

If you have commoditized PC manufacturers, Compact, Dell, IBM, right, there are innumerable number, thousands of companies that made PCs, the value created to the application layer, to the operating system. And the people that can actually build ecosystems are typically the ones that win. And the people that already have an ecosystem, and all they have to do is port somebody from platform A to platform B, has a meaningful advantage over somebody that has to convince you to come to a new platform altogether. And so if you're a Microsoft and you have thousands or hundreds of thousands of developers, or if you're Google and you have hundreds of thousands of developers, or if you're Apple and you have millions of developers, it's just a smaller bridge to cross in order to convince them to build for one extra endpoint.

iOS versus Android. Versus Microsoft. And by the way, it seems like the obvious transition where it's like Facebook is like, you got to go build all this stuff. And Apple made an incredibly important set of decisions a few years ago, which I didn't think a lot of people talked about, but they had an OS tree that was branching far too widely, right? They had a different operating system for the phones. They had a different operating system for iPads, desktop for watches, and they started to try to converge and to hone these things into a set of basic primitives so that it's more controllable.

And I suspect the reason is because that gives them more optionality to go into a car, to go into a headset without having to do an entire developer rebuild. Even better than that, Chamath. It's a great point you bring up because they also started investing in their own chipset. And I think all of that chipset innovation gives them a dramatic advantage in having smaller batteries and more processing power in a headset if it does work, which what chips does, what chip asset does Facebook have? None. So I don't want to, I don't think we should say that Facebook is down and out, but let's just qualify what we think can win.

So that's one thing. The other thing to remember is when you look at the PC industry, how did Intel become so dominant? Part of what Intel was able to do to outcompete AMD and everybody else was that program called Intel Inside, which is effectively these co marketing paths through dollars that they would use to actually give an incentive for Dell and for Compact and for all these other folks to basically build the spec. And that was the wind tell monopoly, right? Microsoft and Intel. If you play that out in VR, what you really need is just a bag full of cash because if you give developers a subsidized incentive to build for your platform, they'll do it.

So then again, if you rank the companies, you just need to look at how much cash do they have because those with the most cash. So again, I think the best way to think about this is how many developers do you have today? How much cash do you have today? How much cash will you have in the future? And you can probably rank and just do a reasonable expected value to think about who has the best chance of winning, assuming the platform is roughly equal. Now, if the company on that list with the fewest developers and the least money has a superior device, if that device is superior enough, they can overcome those things.

And Facebook has the least money and Facebook has the least developers. If you have rough parity, I think the person with the most money and the most developers probably has the best chance of winning. I like that framework. Saks, Facebook has the least developers. They have no relationship with developers. In fact, they kind of screwed them over with Facebook. They can act a couple of times, they have the least money, but they do have the largest user base of profiles. So does that give them some advantage here? And how would you rank? Who's going to win? Who's going to lose? Well, I think it gives them an advantage to Jamass framework of porting over their app onto whatever the dominant platform is going to be.

But probably it's the operating system players who are probably going to be able to extend their operating system into this new VRAR world, probably. What I wonder about is, would Facebook have been better off if they were going to run a $10 billion a year money losing division that's highly speculative, would they have been better off gambling that on building their own phone or maybe their own like forked version of an Android phone? And the reason why I say that is the project that I started. I was about to say. Well, we've now seen. We've now seen.

That's not, we dig that. Well, they're losing. They're losing $10 billion a year now because of this one permissions change that Apple has made, right, because are completely dependent on Apple's operating system for a big portion of their revenue. So what is their defense against that? I mean, they're really pretty helpless. If you look just to make a comparison, if you look at the strategic brilliance of Google, what was it? First of all, after they came up with this cash cow, the idea of search and then they combined it with the sort of keyword auction they got from overture, they said that, listen, the next strategic move is we can't let anybody disimmediate us.

So what did they do? They started moving upstream. The first, the first sort of upstream player was the portal, right? So they start competing against Yahoo. They gave away Gmail. Then it was the browser. So it was Microsoft Explorer. So they gave away Chrome. Then it was the operating system. They gave away androids. They said, we're not going to let anybody else be upstream of us. And so they started replacing all those layers of the stack, giving away free products with free. Sorry. And a good free product. Yeah, great. I mean, all those have billions of users.

I also say a big part of the monetization lock in was Google then extended into the publishers very quickly with the acquisition of AdSense. And the publishers then allowed Google to offer the greatest CPM that those publishers could have over any other advertising network. And as a result, Google built their network and then built their advertiser base. And they effectively got this huge lock in. The only disruptive threat to Google was what Facebook did, which is to create demographic profiles where instead of targeting ads based on keyword or search intent, you could now target ads based on demographic.

And then Facebook took it a step further and did retargeting. So basically following you across multiple sites. But Facebook always knew. And as we just discovered, that was always going to be a weak point for them because they were dependent upon hardware devices that were going to let them do that tracking across apps and across sites. And that's why Google always had this kind of key lock in advantage that will persist. And the network is just so big on both sides, you can't compete. To Saks's thought bomb, if they had invested in a phone, let's say they made $1,000.

Let's say they made a phone with a bomb of $800 or something. They posted this, by the way. Just remember the Fire TV, the Fire phone. And he gave a bunch of great speeches. You can watch these and what happened with that. And just despite his extraordinarily large user base, his committed loyal users, all these reasons, his magical, talented technical team, he hired the best people. He also tried to do the same with Search, by the way, with A9. And remember, Apple also tried to do the same with Search. All these guys tried to kind of compete.

It's not easy to execute. Yeah. It's not easy to execute. And you get a lock in with the network value, but you also get a lock in with the talent. And this was a really hard thing to pull off. And you have to get it all right. So let me ask Chamath a question based on what Saks said. Should they have deployed $10 billion into phones? If we go back two years and they did deploy $10 billion into phones, they take an $800 bomb, which is probably what the best iPhone costs. I think it costs $700 for Apple to make, and they still have for $1,500.

They could basically give the phone away for half price, maybe give it away for $400 or $500. That's what Firephone was. And if they gave away for $400 and you had to be a Facebook user, you buy it, they get the credit card of the person, that would be, they could put 25 million phones into the market every year. That's what Amazon thought, and it didn't work. I don't think that moves the needle. So you don't think it would work? It didn't create a better user experience for users. Users got a better experience with the iPhone, and then they got a better experience with Android.

The window of time was in 2009, 10, and 11 when there wasn't lock in. And I think that's been well discussed about what we were doing and what we tried to do, so there's no point rehashing it. But why did Facebook give that up? Because there wasn't an initiative, right? It wasn't that. It came down to an ask that I made that we didn't get, and it didn't happen. So it didn't happen. We'll leave it at that. Yeah, but I'm not saying that would have been successful. I'm just saying... Neither die. We didn't get to the starting line, so we'll never know.

Yeah. In fact, I think it's unlikely that it would have worked, because I'm not sure exactly what Facebook's value prop would have been. My point is just if you're going to lose $10 billion a year on a division, wouldn't it be better for it to be something strategically vital as opposed to something that feels a little bit optional? Yeah. Even if the majority chances you don't win, the question is if you had a 20, 30, 35% chance of being a player in smartphones, would you take that chance? And I think you have no choice but to take that chance, and it would be worth it, the expected value.

Yeah. One thing I'll say in defense of Facebook is I think that all of this antitrust scrutiny is a little bit ridiculous today, and it looks pretty ridiculous. And let me just explain why. It seems that capitalism is pretty much working as intended, because if you looked at Google's results, if you looked at Snap's results, at Pinterest's results, at Amazon's results, there is a vibrant and growing advertising ecosystem. By no means could you claim that Facebook has any real monopoly on that, number one. And when you fold in TikTok, it's absolutely true. And then if you think about the usage curve of TikTok, there's a check and balance there on usage.

And so anybody that thinks that Facebook is a monopoly today, I think is a little misguided. So really, I think what politicians need to do today, February 4th, is be a little bit more honest about what they really care about, which is really around section 230 and the misinformation, disinformation, fears that they have related to Facebook's distribution power. Because now, if you're going to try to legislate this company, it's really unfair, especially going back 10 years to litigate an acquisition, you'd never do that to any other company that is sort of maybe on the back half of their growth cycle.

It just doesn't make any sense. It would be like going after Google now for the YouTube acquisition. Amazon reported $31 billion of advertising revenue. Crazy. I mean, there is a vibrant, diverse advertising ecosystem. Facebook is not in control of that ecosystem. And so trying to legislate them as a monopoly in that ecosystem is insane today. What do you think, Sacks? Do you think this regulation is based on the fact that Facebook kicked off Trump and is scaring politicians over actual competitive reality? I think that politicians are using the threat of regulation to try and drive the speech policies they want on these social networks.

That's what's really going on. I mean, the merits of the case. Yeah, so you agree with me. It's nothing to do with the business. Yeah, look, who should get regulated on antitrust grounds? Apple. Apple is, and maybe Google. Why? Well, they're the big monopolists. I mean, they control the operating system. I mean, those guys are... 90% of search. And I would say Amazon with respect to the verticals where they're competing with their own... Yeah, basics....with the basics. Exactly. So in other words, when you control an operating system and then there's developers or other downstream players on that ecosystem, you have to treat them fairly.

You can't privilege your own policy to then dominate vertical after vertical. So there are real antitrust concerns with those three companies. The Facebook, way less so. And yet they get the brunt of the attacks. Why? Because the people in Washington are trying to coerce Facebook into controlling what they call misinformation, which is really just speech they don't like. And then that is highly inappropriate. Perfect segue. Last week, we didn't jump into the Rogan Spotify debate. Maybe we should have. But we'll talk about it now with a lot more context. Obviously, Neil Young and some other folks that were pulling our music off, Johnny Mitchell, whatever, some actual high profile bloggers said they don't want to be on there.

And then Joe Rogan and Daniel Eck both decided to talk about this. Joe Rogan said, listen, I'm a comedian. I don't prepare for these air views. And I just see where they go. But this show has gotten very influential. It's the number one podcast in the world, it's got a ridiculous listenership. So maybe I should have it labeled. And maybe I should have people on afterwards. And maybe I should do some extra fact checking. I thought it was the best non apology, you know, explainology of an apology because he did say, I'm sorry if you don't like it.

But he did kind of say that he would do better. And then Daniel Eck said, and then I'll let you guys comment. Daniel Eck said, listen, we produce shows and we approve guests for the ringer and for Gimlet, which we own those studios. We license Joe Rogan. We don't do any editing on his show and we will remove ones after the fact, but it's a licensing deal. Therefore, we're not a publisher. I'm curious what you thought, Friedberg on the non apology and copability for someone like Joe Rogan having guests on who are anti vax or maybe are debatable in terms of science.

Because yeah, he is a comedian. But as he says, like the show is kind of big now. So maybe I should do a little fact checking. What do you think he should do when he has scientists and people and people on? I'll make two points. One is I don't think that journalism is regulated in the sense that we have freedom of speech. So anyone can stand up and they can say, I have this belief or I have discovered this fact and you may not actually hold that belief and that fact may not be true, but you're still allowed to stand up and say it and you're still allowed to have someone come on and say it.

And so I don't think that there's any disclosure obligation. He's putting on a show. It's the same as any new show or entertainment show. I don't think that there's a clear line or boundary. I mean, what the heck do we do here? We've all got opinions. We try and talk about the news. We talk about our perspectives on the future. What the heck is it that we're doing here? There's no kind of clear line there. So I don't think that he has any obligations to do anything he doesn't want to do, except if and when his audience tells him or the listeners that he cares about tell him, his customers tell him, this is what we expect and want from you.

And then he responds to his customers. That's the way the market works and that's the way the enterprise system should work. I think the separate bigger question here that's really important and worth noting. And I just want to speak about this for one second. All of the great internet companies started with this notion that they were creating democratization, that they were creating access to information that didn't exist, whether it's access to media or access to search results or access to content or whatever that may not have been available to you. And that was a driving force for the entrepreneurs and the founders that started all these businesses.

And all of them had these very idealistic points of view that we're not going to censor. We're not going to take a point of view. We're not going to put our foot down and say what is and isn't going to be displayed or shown or made available to our users. We're going to let users choose what they want to get access to and what they want to hear and listen to. And in all these cases, from Google to YouTube to Twitter and now to Spotify, the idea of being just an access, a platform for access is proving to be wrong.

All of them are de facto publishers. They ultimately have to make decisions about what they do and don't let on the platform. And de facto, if you let something on the platform, you're giving it permission. You're giving it a voice. You're giving it amplification and you're giving it access. And so all of them are now getting caught up in this problem that I don't think anyone from Larry or Sergey or Jack Dorsey or Daniel Eck ever wanted to be in. They all wanted to be these democratization platforms. And now they're finding that there is no way to avoid being treated like a publisher or a publisher.

It has someone that's called an editor and an editor decides what is and isn't put on that publishing platform. As has always been the case in old media and now in new media, they're all kind of stumbling into this problem and they're not set up for it. And it's creating issues where people on the right are saying you're censoring us and people on the left are saying you're not giving us access to information we want. And it's just kind of the transition that none of them expected, but we're all seeing happen. Shemath, if Daniel Eck is giving $100 million to Joe Rogan, can he claim, listen, it's just we're a platform when, listen, we're on Spotify as well, but they don't pay us.

Doesn't it change the relationship when they give him the $100 million or can Daniel say, you know, intellectually, honestly, like, hey, listen, we're not responsible for this. I mean, they're backing up the brinkstruck and they're promoting it like heck. Are they a publisher or not in your mind? I read yesterday that Barack and Michelle Obama's deal with Spotify just expired and they're going to shop it. I suspect that somebody will pay them tens of millions of dollars to produce content. That's not illegal. And it's a sign of a free market that's working. Spotify has a business to run and that business is to get content in front of the users that are paying them a lot of money on a monthly basis to get access to that stuff.

And so who are we to say how Spotify should run their business? I think you have a choice. Neil Young expressed his choice. There was a person in the New York Times, she took her podcast off of Spotify. There are subscribers that probably left, but then there are also subscribers that probably joined. Yep. And paid. And paid. And so the reality is that's the free market being allowed to choose and being allowed to vote with their feet. And I think that all sides of that are in the right. So I think Spotify should be allowed to run their business.

I think Joe Rogan should be allowed to say what he wants. If Spotify chooses to put a disclaimer in front of that podcast, that's their right and that's good too. And if Joe Rogan decides that he wants to have point counterpoint across podcasts or within a podcast, that's laudable as well. And that should be his decision. But I don't think people should be forced to make these decisions by law because I think we get into a very slippery slope because you don't totally understand the incentives of the lawmaker there. And we have a free market as you're pointing out, Shema.

The free market is working perfectly. And more people don't like this free market. More important than the free market. And we have a founding document of principles that we all agree to. Yes. And unfortunately, there's a lot of people who don't agree to it. That says we have a right. If you're talking about the First Amendment. So here we go. Let's go to our constitutional attorney, counselor. Take us there. If you're talking about the principle of free speech, there's a lot of people who don't believe in it. That's the problem. First of all, you have this geriatric hippie.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can I finish? Let me finish my rant, Jake. You can get in. Okay. Rant away, rant away. You got this geriatric hippie. I love Neil Young. No, you know what happened here? Wait, sorry, Sax. I was just there. That was J. Cal seeing, oh, shit, he's going to get a bell claster clip and he got tilted. It's a bell claster clip. I got him interrupted. He had to interrupt you there. That's really brutal, J. Cal. That's not being a good cast. Go ahead, bell caster. I thought you were talking about Joe Biden.

Can I explain? Go ahead, Sax. Can I actually explain what happens? I think, frankly, you guys are completely missing it. The wheel of censorship broke on Joe Rogan this week. They tried to Alex Jones him and it failed. Okay. So, we have this geriatric hippie Neil Young who somehow has turned into a narc and he plants a flag and he tries to get all these people behind him. And the very online crowd says, yes, we got to cancel Rogan. And then you got Jen Pesaki from the White House weighing in, bringing in the coercive power of the administration on the side of censorship.

Okay. And what happens? Rogan comes out with this non apology, like you said, and he seems so reasonable. He's a guy who's inquisitive. He's on the side of just asking questions. He's on the side of balance. He says, yeah, look, I want to present both sides of the issue. And everybody was like, there is no reason to be censoring this guy. Rogan is an every man. And if they would censor him, they would censor every man. And that is why there was an enormous backlash to it and everybody has opposed this. And so, I think this is the week that this ridiculous idea of censorship has broke.

Now, it would be nice if everybody to Chamos point did agree with this principle, but they don't. And the fact of the matter is, J. Cal, that censorship is now the official position of the Democrat Party. And you see it in the poll numbers. There was a great tweet that Glenn Greenwald posted where he showed the polling numbers on this. So, okay, you go back to the days of the Obama administration, both Democrats and Republicans agreed that the US government and tech companies should not get involved in this type of censorship. But today, there's been a bifurcation.

Democrats or lean Democrats versus Republicans who lean Republicans at 6528 in favor of government taking steps to restrict info online. And it's 7637 Democrats versus Republicans on tech companies. So long. The first amendment is no longer a consensus. And that is familiar. The issue. But I got to tell you, I think there is a backlash against this. And I think that most of the country now, and I think this is where they went too far, is that Rogan is not Alex Jones. He's not Trump. He's not Milo Unopolis. He seems like a reasonable guy. He is the biggest figure in independent journalism.

He gets 11 million viewers every week. And I think there's a lot of people, especially young people who are going, this has gone too far. And by the way, I do not think Obama ever would have made this political blunder of effectively denouncing Rogan because Obama tried to appeal to young voters. And I think Jim Pesachie, by putting the administration on the side of this censorship, they have made a huge mistake. And the same week, we saw that Tucker Carlson now gets more young Democrats listening to his show than CNN and MSNBC. And I'm telling you, this is the reason why.

Okay, Henry, you can put in the roaring crowd of applause at this point. The best, the best. You've got big problems. I'm telling you, J.K., you got big problems in the Democratic Party. I'm an independent. Stop making the difference. I'm an independent. There are now more Tucker Democrats, okay. Among the key young demographic in CNN Democrats. In your writer's room or Tucker's writer room, which one? Yeah, I'm a Tucker Democrat, J.K. You're a Tucker. You are. You love Obama. You love Clinton. I think what's happening is that, I mean, and Chammath, you've said this over and over again.

Chammath? I'm sorry. Chammath, paliappatiya. You had on one side, you know, the right went, lost their mind in the all right. Now they've come a little bit more center. And then you may not have the Democrats have lost their minds. The fact that anybody can't look at Joe Rogan and say he's a comedian, he worked on a show where they fed people shakes of blended insects, feel factor, and he's taking mushrooms and he's like, why are you taking me so seriously? Well, wait, I think you're being, hold on. I think you're being super dismissive of Joe Rogan.

I think he's actually, as Sack said, a pretty reasonable, curious person. And then yeah, he does the stuff that everybody else does. But he doesn't prepare for the show. He literally said, I don't prepare for the show. I don't do any preparation. Maybe he does or maybe he doesn't. No, he said explicitly he doesn't. And he fact checks in real time. So you got to keep your expectation at a certain level with Joe Rogan, I think. I think that that's implausible to believe. I know that that's what he said, but 11 million people a week, a hundred million dollar deal, I do suspect that he does some sort of preparation.

I don't think he's completely winging it. He literally said he wings it. But okay, I understand that. But I think that's not the point. The point is whether he prepares or not, the excuse isn't sorry, the dog ate my homework. It's hey, listen, I have a right to have this guy on my show. Just like I have the right to have this other guy on my show. You can listen to both and then you can decide for yourself. You could change the channel. Okay. That's the important point. So Jason, I would not like try to make this whole arguing about whether he was prepared or unprepared as the excuse.

It's whether you believe there's a fundamental right to free speech or whether you believe that people who disagree can disavow people and get them canceled and get them. Yeah, I obviously don't agree. I don't agree. Anybody should be canceled. I think he should keep going. Whatever Rogan's level of preparation, which I think is actually pretty high, the people who are accusing him of putting out misinformation are far more guilty of it themselves. And I think one of the best points in Rogan's non apology, as you called it, is he said, listen, a lot of the things that we used to consider misinformation are now the truth.

For example. We talked about it on the show. Well, we've been ahead of the curve in calling all this stuff out. You know, we could have been accused of misinformation. So examples, the lab leak theory, you speak in some misinformation, the cloth mass not doing anything. Listen, Dan Bongino was kicked off YouTube two weeks before the CDs for saying that Dan Bongino, he's a pretty big conservative commentator. Okay. He's got an audience of millions. You can be dismissive, but a lot of people like him. Yeah. J. Cal. But look, my point is he was kicked off YouTube for saying cloths mass don't work.

And the CDC comes out two weeks later and says the same thing. Right. I think that's a valid point. Well, it's the key point. I personally, like, you know, for example, we've talked about this thing where like, if you look at like the top distributed links on Facebook, who do you see? Ben Shapiro. Yeah. Dan Bongino. You know, Brightport. Rogan. Right. Yeah. My takeaway with all of these things is there are people of those things. If I listened to, I'd probably find a porrant, but there are people there that are probably, I would be, you know, I would, I would, I would, they would appeal to me.

In all cases, they should all exist though, because the whole point is, let me spider my way through this stuff and figure out for myself what works and what doesn't work. More speech is the best counter. The summary of this that makes the most sense is Elon tweeted this out. Nick, you can put this because I gave you the image, but it's a meme of Neil Young where it says, if you won't censor the guy I don't like, I won't let you listen to keep on rocking in a free world. And it's, and it's just so true, which is like on the one hand, you know, you are, you are a standard bearer.

Now maybe what we should really do is talk about what has happened to this boomer generation over the last 50 years where they were, you know, sex, drugs, rock and roll, no war in Vietnam. Let's fight for our rights. Let's fight for equality. Then punk rock. You know, no, I'm talking about just those, those folks back then who are now 50 years later, you know, sitting on $70 trillion of wealth and who are basically like, you can't say this, you can't say that. Don't do this. Don't do that. Wear masks. Don't leave your house. You know, Fauci is right.

Well, I mean, they're scared because they're old. Wear masks. Or you're getting canceled. It came from the Pangolin. You know, this is, I mean, that generation, I think we all have some soul searching to do about what happened to that generation. I think they're scared because they're old and they feel like they're going to die from COVID. Is it that generation or is it the fact that every generation rebels against the prior and ultimately becomes conservative? And you know, that's the, that's just how life goes. I don't think they become conservative. I think they become authoritarian.

I think that what happened is they're now in power. The boomers are in power. They've been making the decisions for the last 20 years. I think there is enormous popular discontent with the way the country's been run over the last two decades, the futile pointless wars in the Middle East, the debt, the economy, the unfairness that it goes on and on. And what, and especially with COVID, I mean, this COVID policy over the last two years has been a fiasco. And the point of this censorship of misinformation is to suppress the debate. I mean, what ultimately is the point on, take for example, COVID of saying that people cannot take a point of view.

It is to stifle the debate, that's to prevent an honest debate on these issues. And the people who have an interest in doing that are the people who are in charge and are failing. And if you gave people the information, they'd be voted out of office. If you look, when I asked, what are the specific claims that either Joe Rogan or his guests made that people are objecting to? A lot of the people who were objecting and wanted him censored really didn't know. And one of them was, he said early on, I don't know for a young person who's in shape if I would advise them to take the vaccine.

I know a lot of people who have that position, which is like, if you're young, and I think actually Freeberg, you might have said mRNA early on in this podcast is a very new technology. And I could see people wanting to wait and see. Did you not say that? I don't want to get you canceled here, but I think we did have that discussion. I did not have that conversation. That's a valid conversation. mRNA is a new technology, right, Freeberg? You should think about it and we should be cautious. Don't draw me into your cancel debate here.

That's why I said we. I just changed it to we were talking about that. Don't you remember that discussion we had? And I asked you, I think, mRNA, what do you think of this versus the regular one, the J&J? I think generally we've seen science being used as a term to discredit what I think would arguably and typically be scientific principles, which is inquiry, challenging hypotheses and having, you know, vigorous debate to resolve to some sort of objective truth. Otherwise you're having some sort of subjective belief. And more often than not, we've seen politicians and others grab on to the term science and saying, this is science.

It says this. When in fact, the process of science is inquiry and it is to challenge, you know, again, a hypothesis and what might be kind of a thesis. So yeah, I think generally this has been a pretty scary time to watch because it's almost like gaslighting, you know, it's like, hey, you know, you're using the term science to discredit the notion of science. It's been pretty brutal. I think you guys this cartoon link, by the way, it's so funny. Oh, I just got it. Old left versus the modern left. It's a Volkswagen bus with a bunch of hippie, dippy flowers and it says free speech, free law of 1971.

No CIA, screw the establishment, resist authority. And then it shows like a modern SUV with 2021. It says masks up, I heart the CDC, obey the establishment, no free speech, do what you're told, obey basically. You have another poll you want to share sex? Well, yeah, this is a really interesting one. It says a majority of voters, 55% say COVID should be treated as an endemic disease while a majority of Democrats say it should be continued to be treated as an emergency. And then there was a similar poll, the Monmouth poll just came out where 89% of Republicans, 71% of of independence say that it's time we accept, we accept COVID is here to stay and we need to get on with our lives only 40 shirts and the Democrats.

So the reality is that the rest of the country, I think has moved on, it's ready to move on. The split is not between Democrats and Republicans anymore. It's within the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is now divided on this question of whether we should move on as a country past COVID. Half of the Democratic Party still believes that COVID should be treated as this emergency. Do you think that it's cut by age? Do you think there's a bias by age? For sure, for sure. I think, yes, absolutely. Old people are more scared. Yeah. But I think the media and the party, they've programmed their soldiers to be, you know, to treat COVID as an emergency and they can't deprogram them.

And this is why I think we're seeing Tucker is now the biggest demographic among young Democrats. That's insane to me. It's insane. The idea, that idea is insane. This does not bode well for the, on top of everything else that's happening in the country, this does not bode well for the Democrats in November. And then you had this crazy thing at the Magic Johnson party at that football game. Oh, that was the best. I held my breath. I took a picture of Magic Johnson. I held my breath so I wouldn't get the virus. Yeah, with Garcetti and Newsom.

And Newsom claimed... It's the new, I didn't inhale. Yeah, exactly. And then Newsom says that he was only photographed at the exact moment where he took off his mask for two seconds, you know. You know what? If you go to the ski slopes, there is nobody with a mask on and nobody's enforcing it and no restaurants. And this is in Democratic country. Everybody has moved on at this point. Everybody's willing to... But why haven't they? Why haven't Newsom and Garcetti... The media and the politician, because they're virtual signaling and they want to keep power. But to who? I don't know.

You tell me. That's the point. I think they're afraid of their own voters. They should take the position that we reopen. Yeah, they should just take the real... I think they're afraid of their own voters. But wouldn't taking the reopening position get you more voters at this point? People are tired of this. They want to move on. It doesn't make any sense. They're making a bad political decision. I think they're beholden to their base. That's the point is I think the whole country has moved on. Even most Democrats have moved on, but the Democratic base has not moved on.

And that is why Newsom and Garcetti have to pay lip service to this. Well, I mean, and these guys have been telling everybody, got to wear a mask, got to wear a mask and they're not wearing masks. And let's face it. They're not wearing masks at the French Laundry. They have never worn masks. They've been throwing their own parties with no masks. They're a bunch of hypocrites. The whole lot of them. All right. In other news, Xi Jinping and Putin got together and they're apparently besties. Here's the quote, some actors representing but the minority on the international scale.

I think that's us. Continue to advocate unilateral approaches to addressing international issues and resort to force. They interfere in the internal affairs of other states infringing their legitimate rights and interests and incite contradictions, differences and confrontation. The statement said, I am willing to work with President Vladimir Putin to plan a blueprint and guide the direction of Sino Russian relations under new historical conditions. Mr. Xi said he added that China and Russia should act like big countries as a intensify coordination on fighting the coronavirus pandemic. Yada, yada. Any feedback from our squad? I mean, you could have rewritten that press release as we will, we want to try to destroy US hegemony and replace it with ourselves.

This is the beginning of the end of US cultural and economic influence globally. Or dominance, rather influence globally. I think that it's something that we've talked about quite a lot. I mentioned in the prediction episode that I thought that Putin was going to play a major role this year. He's clearly not just out for his own interests, but he's going to play a really important role in China's rise to economic and cultural dominance. You agree, Chamath? Is this the sign that they're going to be running the show? Or does this look like something else to you? No, no, no.

I don't think that there's a show to run. I think the point is that there was a first among equals for the last many decades in the world order where America was that first among equals. I think what they're saying is that it's time for that to change. They're going to tie that to their ability to influence foreign policy in countries the way that we have historically. This is basically putting a marker on the table that says this is going to be about a different cohort of people that are also going to have an equal say.

If you think about where this all plays out, it's always in economics. This is where, again, you have to think about what China has done, which is they have, while we were fighting wars, putting trillions of dollars into the Middle East, they took their trillion dollars and bought resources all through Africa. They built infrastructure. They bought infrastructure all through South America. They put infrastructure all through Southeast Asia. That, say, call it $15 trillion that we spent in one direction, they spent another. That's a $30 trillion gap that's going to create a resource imbalance that they will use to create even more influence in the future.

We have to figure out a way to counteract that. Sacks, what do you think? Is this a changing moment in the world order? Should we be worried that these two dictators are going to act in unison and then maybe one gets the Ukraine, one gets Taiwan? Is this really earth shattering news or do you think it's saber rattling and not that big of a deal? Well, I think it's a dramatic statement and photo that was put out. That was a continuation of what we've seen where they have, you know, Xi and Putin have been getting, and Russia and China, they've been getting friendlier and friendlier.

What saddens me and sort of sickenes me as really an American patriot who would like to see the American world order continue is the way that we have blundered and created this type of situation. So to Chimás point, first of all, we wasted 20 years trying to do nation building in the Middle East. We wasted $6 trillion on that. How did China lose by not being part of that? They benefited. They were building built and road while we were engaged in this foolish interventions in the Middle East. And now more recently with Putin, we've really driven Putin into Xi's arms because we keep threatening to add Ukraine to NATO, which is not something that's in America's interest.

If we would just give up on that position or just reaffirm that Ukraine should not be a nation NATO would enormously help diffuse tensions with Russia. And by the way, your point that these are dictators or natural allies, that's not historically been true. So during the days of the Soviet Union, you had Nixon and Kissinger make the great opening to Mao and China, and we were able to cultivate a relationship there because China and Russia were natural antagonists. And it was a major move in the Cold War that we were able to cultivate Mao. And we did so even though he was a dictator with blood on his hands.

So Russia and China are not natural allies. We should be doing a better job of not so thoroughly alienating Putin that he is rushing into Xi's arms. That's the blunder I see here. By the way, after this summit, they're going to meet with Iran. There's a tripartite, I think. Access of dictators. This is like the Legion of Doom. We need to be playing our cards in a much smarter way. Yeah, we need to play our cards. What is the strategy? I mean, that's what I'm trying to figure out. The strategy is, look, we want the American led world order to continue, but we got to be much more selective about picking and choosing our battles.

Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, they were huge mistakes. And now on top of it, we're talking about Ukraine. What's that? Yeah, looking forward like you keep bringing up the past. What's a look forward strategy in your mind? The look forward strategy, I think, is to diffuse and deescalate the situation in Ukraine exactly the way Obama did it, which is to recognize that America does not have a vital national interest the way that Russia does. Then how do you handle Taiwan? To reaffirm that the nations of the Caucasus that have border disputes with Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, they are not eligible candidates for NATO at the present time.

Kick that can down the road by 10 years. Okay. We talked about that last episode. Taiwan is a much more complicated situation. I do think we have a vital national interest there. Got it. Okay. So two very different situations. I agree with you. Yeah. I think Taiwan, we have to hold the line. We have a responsibility in the United States, and I think we're starting to do it. So I think there is good news where part of the strategic vital interest for Taiwan is because they have critical resources that we need and we depend on.

And specifically, those are semiconductors. We have now, I think, allocated $50 billion, $100 billion of capital of CapEx across a bunch of companies that have committed to building domestic capability. And so we have to make sure we follow through on that and that's successful. And the reason is that it gives us optionality. It allows us to breathe. It allows us to actually make rational decisions and be patient in our decision making. And I think that's going to be really important over the next 10 or 20 years. And so we have to invest in the United States.

So the solution to all of these things is we cannot be overly dependent on any one country, any one shipping lane, any one product, any one natural resource. You just can't do that anymore. We have to be strong at home and we have to build strong relationships with other countries. And yeah, I think we've got an operating philosophy here. All right, listen, let's wrap there. We'll see everybody on the next episode for the dictator, Chamath Palihapetia, the Sultan of Science, David Friedberg, and the Rain Man himself, triumphant versus Peter Thiel and that PayPal match great moment, David Sax.

Love you boys. Love you besties. Bye bye. Bye bye. We'll let your winners ride. Rain Man David Sax. And it said, we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it. I'm going on. I'm going on. I'm going on. I'm going on. Besties are gone. This is my dog taking an audition. Oh man. My avid actor will meet me at once. He should all just get a room and just have it one big huge orgy because they're all just useless. It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.

What? You're about to beat me. I'm going on. I'm going on. I'm going on. I'm doing all in.
