What's called a sex LP meeting? Is it an LP meeting or you go are you going to lunch Peter Tio? What's going on? It's 9 a.m. You must be there must be a call going on here. It's actually put to the BNN It's a dach sex every week, but Chamathas in Italy another button guts undone. This is definitely Hey everybody, hey everybody welcome to another episode of the all in podcast episode 36 back with us today on the program the Queen of Kinwa science spectacular Freedberg is with us again with leading off last episode Freedberg with a great Freedberg science monologue the crowd went crazy for it How does it feel coming off that epic performance in episode 35? Tell us what were you thinking going into the game and Yeah, well, I was thinking I would talk about the Alzheimer's drug approval at Biogen and I felt like I did it when we were done Great.

Yeah, it's just it's like literally interviewing Kauai Leonard after like a 50 point game Okay, and with us Rain Man David Sacks with layers for players. He's been styled and groomed And he's in some random hotel room. How are you doing Rain Man? Good good? I'm not I'm not in the hotel room. I'm oh Your home just happens to look like a five star resort got it forgot that And give us an idea coming into today's game With the layers you obviously are here to dominate and get your monologues up Gotta be hard for you to look at the stat line and see yourself trailing in monologues behind the dictator I'm referring to all in statistics.

Yeah, where some maniac is breaking down how many minutes we each talk Jason I'm really happy with my performance for me. It's about quality and our quantity. I like to Stick and jab. Okay. God. God. What are we talking about right now? What what? What is the hell are you talking about right now? My account done. You know how the the all in stands have a ton of skills Like there is an audience for this podcast that has more skills Then you know, it's like the five percent of the most skilled people in the world listen to this podcast So in addition to doing the merge in addition to doing who's the guy Henry who does all those incredible videos with animations? In addition to those Yeah, every bellcaster crushing those things are great.

Those are amazing and then of course You have young Spielberg who led the charge dropping incredible credible tracks And now we have this new crew that is analyzing Somebody put you know, we'll put in the show notes a link to it, but they do some type of AI analysis of The audio files and they tell us who had the most monologues and then the running time and then historic running time So they're actually looking at it trying to figure out, you know Who is speaking the most and they thought Friedberg was gonna run away with the episode But it kind of disappeared in the second half of the game And Schmoth obviously came around the corner and took his 27% But they live a pie chart of how much we each talk I have a I always have a very strong first and third quarter Yes, absolutely.

Yeah, and then he gets frustrated when he passes the ball and somebody misses a shot It's kind of like LeBron in the early days. So kicking off today Lena Khan has been confirmed to the FTC with bipartisan support interesting And this is obviously gonna be a challenge for big tech on Tuesday The Senate voted 69 to 28 to confirm Lena Khan who is a very well established critic of big tech And this is obviously really unique because she's 32 years old and she's lead at Tc, which is Unbelievable I did a little research on her and watched some videos She's basically written two amazing papers and The first paper came out in 2017 Amazon's anti trust paper the second one came out in June And was about the separation of platforms and commerce and when you hear her speak she is incredibly Credible and knowledgeable it is as if One of the four of us were discussing this she could come into this podcast and speak credibly about Amazon's businesses as opposed to the charades we saw at different hearings where the senators and Congress people just absolutely had no idea what they're talking about Some of the items I picked up from a talk she gave in Aspen is that She will she formed a lot of these opinions by talking to venture capitalists who were concerned about Amazon's dominance and other companies And the competitive space and she is looking at consumer welfare One of the lenses of anti trust which will I'm sure David's actually have some thoughts on as our resident attorney here And the framing of those in terms of harm of the consumer.

She believes there's other harm that happens And she thinks one remedy is to kill Amazon basics because the marketplace shouldn't own the goods as well She's concerned about cloud computing a consolidation because that creates fragility and that is another type of consumer harm While she freely admits that prices have gone down services are free and this is a consumer benefit So she wants to rethink the entire concept and she is savvy. She brought up Facebook buying a Novo the Reportedly spyware VPN to give them a little advantage as to what was being used on phones and maybe give them a little product roadmap information she also Brought up Amazon studying the sales of other products to inform Amazon basics a claim that Amazon says they don't do But everybody knows they do do because all that information is publicly available She talked about Amazon's VC arm using data to invest in buying companies.

Why wouldn't they that makes total sense? That's great signal for them. She seems to want Amazon web services spun out which I think would just double the value of it or maybe add 50% of the value of it and She gave very pragmatic examples like maybe separating Google Maps from Android and when you turn on your Android phone You you would have to install maps or maybe you would pick from the different maps that are out there different Programs and that there would be integration in them and people could swap out You know a map quest or Apple Maps in their Google searches So a lot of actually very interesting pragmatic approaches and she doesn't think these need to be decade long lawsuits She thinks this is going to be a negotiation And that people will kind of work together on it but this is all with the backdrop of Partisan politics and you know one group of people looking at this through the lens of wealth and Inequality and another group looking at it through censorship sacks since you are our counsel here.

What are your thoughts on this appointment? Yeah, I mean the interesting thing is that you know Lena Khan is the Bernie approved candidate She is liked by the progressive left, but at the same time she got 21 Republicans to support her And so this nomination, you know sailed through confirmation I think what she's saying it what she's saying. I think there's There's a very good good argument to it that and I've said similar things in the past Which is you know what she's basically saying especially in the case of Amazon is look you've got this company Amazon that controls essential infrastructure AWS the whole distribution supply chain going all the way from the port to warehouses to To logistics and distribution that is going to be owned by a scaled monopoly player You have a common massive economies of scale.

It's pretty clear They're going to dominate that and what they're doing is systematically going category by category and using the monopoly monopoly profits they make by owning the sort of core infrastructure and Subsidizing their entry into each of these new categories that Amazon basics and others and she calls that you know It's predatory pricing and she's afraid that Amazon's is going to end up dominating every category every Category that you could build on top of this core infrastructure. I think it's actually a pretty valid concern I think you see something analogous happening with Apple and Google and the app stores We had a congressional hearing pretty recently which you had Spotify on other apps Complaining about what Apple was doing to them saying they are making our service non viable with the 30% rake that they're charging You remember Bill Gurley had a great post about this saying just because you can charge a 30% rake doesn't mean you should right now We're seeing this blowback from this massive 30% rake and you had Spotify saying look Apple is doing this to basically make us Infeasible relative to Apple music So I think there is a legit point here, which is that if you own the monopoly platform the sort of essential infrastructure You cannot use it to basically take over every application on that can be built on top of that platform That I think is a very appropriate use of of antitrust law and I think so I think that's the good here now I think that there are some some concerns or some potential downsides and You know and the downside that I see is that we used to think we used to judge Antitrust law in terms of consumer welfare And so so there was a limiting principle to the actions of government Which is you would just look at prices and the effect on prices here You know the the sort of movement that Lena Con represents the so called hipster antitrust movement They're concerned about power and they want to restructure Markets to avoid sort of concentrations of power I don't see the limiting principle there and so I think what the Would market share be a limiting principle? Well, it would be a limiting principle in terms of who you could take action on but it wouldn't be a limiting principle in terms of How you would restructure the market and I think what we're in for over the next few years is potentially a hyper political politicization of big tech markets I think these 21 Republicans might soon feel like the dog who caught the bumper in the sense that yes They're finally gonna have the regulation of big tech They've been calling for but they might not like all of the results because we because what could happen is a very intrusive meddling by government in The markets of technology and it could go well beyond sort of this This this gatekeeper principle That we've been talking about that.

I think would be a valid reason to regulate Jamal, I think she has to be careful in focusing on Amazon. So if you break down antitrust law, they're really three big buckets where the attack vectors are and I'm not going to claim to be an expert, but I think They're relatively easy to understand. So you have the first principle body, which is called the Sherman Act That's the thing that everybody's looked at and that's you know, sort of where most current Antitrust Enforcement action has failed on tech companies because it largely looks at the predatory nature of pricing power that certain companies have And you have to remember this thing was written in the 1800s And so, you know, what did people do when they control things? They just they drove prices up tech does the exact opposite, right? They constantly drive prices down and what's counterintuitive is it turns out that in the olden days Driving prices up drove out competition today driving prices down drives out competition.

Yes, right? So, you know, you make Gmail infinite storage Nobody else can compete with why you switch you make, you know Photos completely subsidized you make certain music products effectively free and You subsidize that, you know, you create enormous amounts of content blah blah blah So you have the Sherman Act then somewhere along the way we realized, okay We need to add something we created this thing called the Clayton Act that was around M&A Right, we added to that a lot of folks that are listening probably have heard of Hart Scott Rodino HSR We've all gone through it right on M&A events We have to file these HSR clearances when you make big investments.

For example, you know, I just made a Climate change thing we had to file HSR And then there's this FDC a which is the Federal Trade Commission Act that is where she can get, you know If to use a poker term You know a little frisky why because the FTC a has these two specific things which says you can have an unfair method of competition Or an unfair or deceptive act or practice Now it falls on her and her team to basically build the strongest case around those two dimensions and My only advice to her I wrote this into 2019 in my investor letter as well Just thinking about the breakdown of big tech If you're gonna go after these guys, that's the body of law that probably is the most Defensible But you probably have to start, you know, whether you like it or not with Facebook or Google And the reason is there are more examples how you can use that language under the FTC a To give those folks a hard time.

I think it's much harder. The example would be Chimoth that We are giving away this product losing money on it to keep you in our store and moat you into our Advertising network, etc That's an example. Yeah, that's yeah, or or you know, we then we then and Because then when you have control then you can show that then the first part the Sherman Act part kicks in Why so you've seen 15 or 20 years of Google? Facebook less Apple by the way I'm using their edge to decrease price and For the first time in the last quarter both of these two companies And they were the only two of big tech that announced an increase in pricing, right? They saw a diminishing of CPM inventory And so they had to figure out ways to grow inventory as users started to stagnate and what they really said is we're ramping up CPMs and CPMs.

I think we're up 28 30% in a quarter. Yeah And there's a lot of competition right now for ad space these two ideas together Which is step one is you surreptitiously basically take all the costs out of the system and then step two raise price over time There's probably something there Freedberg when we look at her age and her obvious Deep deep knowledge. Do you see that as an overall plus? I mean, obviously if you know David framed her as the Bernie approved candidate But then conceded that 20 Republicans are backing her What do you what do you think about the massive credibility? She has freeberg in terms of she's actually understands this deeply? clearly I'm sure she's not dumb If that if that's what you're asking I'm not sure.

I mean it's a 32 year old I mean, do we have we seen an appointment like that before? I mean, I don't think so. Yeah, that's that good for her. Yeah so I just feel like there's a bit of a cycle underway where we have this kind of anti wealth anti wealth accumulation Sentiment as an undercurrent right now, you know, obviously Bernie and Elizabeth Warren and others are key vocal Proponents of change that's needed to keep this kind of wealth disparity from continuing to grow and one of the solutions is to reduce the monopolistic capacity of certain business models specifically in technology The downside that I don't think is realized and and that inevitably comes with This action under this new kind of business model of the the technology age or the digital age is the damage to consumers and so, you know as as As as Chimoth and David pointed out like historically anti trust has been about protecting the consumer and the irony is the more Monopoly or the more monopolistic or the more market share Amazon gains the cheaper things get for consumers and And it's unfair to small businesses and to business owners and to competitors But consumers do fundamentally benefit and so the the logical argument she made in her paper that was widely distributed a few years ago What was around this notion that in this new world? It's not about consumer harm And we need to look past the impact to consumers and look more at kind of the you know The fact that this company maybe prevents innovation and prevents competition, but ultimately if the consumer is harmed In the resolution of that concern We're not going to wake up to it for a while and then consumers one day are going to wake up and they're going to be like wait a second why am I paying five bucks for Gmail and You know why am I paying an extra ten dollars for shipping to get my Amazon products brought to me every day? And you know all the things that I think we've taken For granted in the digital age With the advent of these you know call it monopolistic kind of business models where they accumulate market share and they can squeeze Pricing and keep people out and the bigger they get the cheaper they get and therefore it's harder to compete Consumers have benefited tremendously.

I think all of us would be hard pressed to say I would love to pay ten bucks a month for Gmail I'd love to pay for Facebook And at the end of the day these models and I'd love to pay more for shipping with Amazon And so you know it becomes a value question, right? What do you value more? Do you value the opportunity for competition and innovation in the business world or do you value as a consumer better pricing? And I don't think that we're really having that debate And I think that that debate will inevitably kind of arise over the next couple of years if an Freeberg kind of played out and I think to be clear for your bird what you're saying is this is driven by the extraordinary Wealth of Jeff Bezos Zuckerberg, etc It's easy to pinpoint that problem and then not involve the repercussions to consumers If you try and change how business operates in a free market system and these businesses are Successful because they have customers that like competition and they drive in a competitive way of pricing down and they prevent people from coming in and competing Not by entering into contracts and anti trust enforcement all this sort of stuff They're doing it because they're scaling and offering lower prices I mean this like Peter Thiel and Mark Andreessen have separately argued for this in really intelligent ways probably in a far more articulated way than I can But and they did this early on which is you know We want to find businesses that can become monopolies because if you can reduce your pricing and improve your pricing power with scale It's going to be harder and harder for someone to compete and therefore the capital theory is rush a bunch of capital into these businesses Help them scale very quickly I mean this is obviously the basis of uber and others and then get really big really fast create the mode create the Mode drop the pricing and then no one can compete with you on pricing consumers benefit and you've created the big business and you've locked everyone Okay, so let me go around the horn here and frame this for everybody.

Let's assume that Big tech does get breaking up this broken up. This is an exercise We assume it gets broken up and YouTube and Android are spun out Instagram. What's up or spun out AWS is spun out and You know app stores are allowed on Apple's platform iOS for the first time I want to know if this is good bad or neutral for the following two people So these breakups occur. Is it good bad or neutral for consumers? And then two is it good bad or neutral for startups sacks? I Generally would lean towards saying yes.

I mean a lot depends on better neutral for each party startups and for consumers I I think it could ultimately be good for for both, but it really depends on how it's done And I think there is a big risk here that this just degenerates into Sort of hyper politicization You get intensive amounts of lobbying by big tech in Washington that what happens is You know, you have a good cop bad cop where Lena con just becomes the bad cop She's there to kind of keep big tech in line threatens to break them up And then the good cop is you know, Biden and the administration and then they they become the protection and the extortion racket They raise on You know ungodly amounts of money and really it'll be a bonanza for for all elected officials because now Big techs have to increase its donations even more super cynical.

Wow. That's that's a cynical take So we could end up with something much worse than we have now, but but I think the legit I think the words you're gonna hear a lot, okay Are a common carrier because what she seems to be saying is look If you're a tech monopoly that controls core infrastructure, we need to regulate you like a common carrier You cannot summarily deny service to your competitors who are downstream applications built on top of your platform Conservants can get behind that because that is the argument they've been making about facebook cutting off free speech is You are a speech utility You should be regulated as a common carrier.

You cannot cut off people Somarily you cannot discriminate against people who should be allowed to have free speech on your platform And so I think there is I think the left and the right here can cut a deal Where they regulate these guys these big tech companies as common carriers. I think that is what we're headed towards So bakery can deny service as we talked about previous issue to a gay couple who wants a cake because it's a tiny little company And there's other choices But when we're talking about facebook and twitter There are not other choices and once you're removed like trump has been from the public square There is no recourse.

You are essentially zeroed out Chamath is it good for startups bad for startups neutral same thing for consumers if you know one chunk of every company got cleavered off it's unanimously good for startups in any Scenario in which they get involved and I think in most cases in which the government gets involved It's it's good for consumers as well. And why in both cases So for startups, it's just because I think right now we have a massive human capital sucking sound Um that big tech creates in the ecosystem Which is that there is an entire generation of people That are basically unfortunately frittering away their most productive years Getting paid what seems to them like a lot of money But is what is effectively just you know Um Paola to not go to a competitor or go to a startup at buy big tech So to explain that clearly for example, like if you're a machine learning person Right, uh, those machine learning people um, you know can get paid 750 to a million dollars a year to stay at google And instead they won't go to a startup because they take sort of the bird in the hand, right? And you multiply that by 100 or 150,000 very talented, you know technical people And that's actually what you're seeing every day now Those numbers are actually much higher.

You know, if you're if you're a specific AI person, you can get paid 5 10 million dollars a year My point is um, they could have started a startup and made could have and frankly they just million They look let's be honest. They go to google facebook and whatever and I don't think anybody sees the real value of what they're doing in those places Except getting paid now. They're making a rational economic decision for themselves. And so nobody should blame them for that um But if startups had more access to those people Um, or if you know those engineers finally said, you know what enough's enough.

I'm actually going to go and try something new That's net additive to the ecosystem. It's net additive to startups, right? That's that's that's for them and then for consumers. I think the reason why it's positive is that it'll start to show you In which cases you had been giving away something that you didn't realize was either valuable or you didn't realize you were giving away In return for all of these product subsidies that you were getting And I think that's the next big thing that's happening You can see it in the the enormous amount of investment apple, for example Is making in both advertising the push to privacy as well as implementing the push to privacy, you know this last wwdc You know, they really threw the gauntlet down, you know, they they they were really trying to blow up Um, the advertising business models of google and facebook Um, and as consumers become more aware of that They're probably willing to pay more so a simple example is you know, there are a lot of people now who will pay higher prices for food If they know it to be organic Right, there are people who will pay higher prices for electricity or for an electric car because of its impact or the lack thereof in the climate So it's not to say that people always want cheaper faster better.

Right. I mean sometimes people will buy an iphone because it's Obviously protecting their privacy and they know it's not an ad based model and in fact apple is now Making that part of their process. So uh Freeberg I asked the other gentlemen, uh, if they thought some large unit being chopped off of every company youtube, aws Uh instagram you pick it Um would be a net positive for startups or negative or neutral and the same thing for consumers. What do you think? Which gentleman did you ask? You mean sacks? I was specifically referring to the ones who are wearing layers.

Hello, sir. Yes. Uh, I'm using the term Lightly. So if you guys go back a few years ago, you'll uh, remember there were these I think there were congressional hearings and Jeremy Staubelman from Yelp was pretty vocal about how google um was redirecting Search engine traffic to their own kind of reviews and they were pulling Yelp content off the site But then they said to Yelp if you don't want us to pull your content, you can turn the web crawler Toggle off and we won't crawl your site, but your site is publicly available We can crawl it and we show snippets on our home page But then their argument was well, you're using our content to drive your own reviews And they made this whole kind of case that google's kind of monopoly in search was harming their ability to do business Um, you know the the counter argument was well if you guys have a great service consumers will go to your app directly or your website directly to get reviews They won't go to google and so it created a little bit of this kind of noise for a while I think there was some follow up and this is all very much related because ultimately if he was able to get google to stop providing a review service his business would do better Because google would effectively redirect search traffic to his site as opposed to their own internal site So it is inevitably the case that in house apps or in house services that compete with third party services when you're a platform business Um are uh, you know if they're removed it's certainly going to benefit the competitive landscape, which is typically startups Uh, you know imagine if apple didn't have apple maps pre installed on the iphone Everyone would download and use google maps, right? I mean there are yeah map quest whatever or map quest or whatever And so um, you know or whatever startup came along like ways and said hey, we've got a better map But because they have this ability to kind of put that apple maps in front of you as a consumer And it's a default on your phone.

You're more likely to just click on it and start using it and you're done It certainly opens up this window, but I think the question is what's Ultimately best for the consumer if you believe that consumers will choose what's best for themselves You're starting to kind of manipulate with the market a bit and sax. I don't know. I think you've got a different point of view on this but yeah, yeah, well, I'm a I'm a free markets type of guy, but My experience at paypal really changed my thinking on this because paypal It was a startup that launched effectively as an involuntary app on top of the ebay market at that time ebay had a monopoly on the auction market and that was the key sort of beachhead market for online payments So we launched on top of ebay.

They were constantly trying to Dislog us and remove us from their platform and really the only thing keeping them from just switching us off Was was an antitrust thread. We actually spun up You could call it a lobbying operation where we would send information to the fdc and the doj and say listen You've got this auction monopoly here. That's taking anti competitive actions against us this little startup and you know And so we were able to rattle the saber and and sort of brush them back from the plate from taking a You know a much more dramatic action against us and frankly we did something kind of similar with visa mastercard because Paypal was essentially an application on top of visa mastercard as well We offered merchants the ability to accept visa mastercard, but also paypal payments, which were gradually Eating into and supplanting the the credit card payments And so, you know visa mastercard had a very dim view of paypal and they were constantly You know, they were constantly making noise about switching us off And I I do think that without the threat of antitrust hanging over these big monopolies or duopolis It would have been very hard for us as a startup to get the access to these networks that we needed and so it really kind of changed my thinking about it because You know, if you let these giant monopolies run Wild run run amok.

They will absolutely stifle innovation 100% They will become gatekeepers And so you have to have the threat of antitrust action hanging over their heads or you will stifle innovation Absolutely. I mean if you just look at the interesting google flights over time I'm looking at a chart right now. We'll put it into the notes Google flights, you know, I know some of us don't fly commercial anymore But you know for somebody who's looking for flights on a regular basis watching Google intercept flight information put up google flights and it's an awesome product And just Expedia and bookings.com

have so Jason that was that was a company called ita software based out of boston And ita was acquired by google ita was the search engine behind flight search for most companies It was like 70 phds. They were all statistics guys And they basically built this logistical model that identified, you know flights and pricing and all this sort of stuff Oh, wow. So and so they should never been allowed. Well, they created a white label search capability that they then provided and they were making plenty of money providing this as a white label search capability to Expedia and kayak and all the online travel agencies And google wanted to be in that business because travel search was obviously such a big vertical Um, and rather than just buy a travel search site They bought the engine that powers travel search for most of the other sides gangster And then they also revealed the results in their own search result homepage Uh, which effectively cut off the otas and the otas are big spenders on google ads.

So So basically google this is how nefarious it is if i'm hearing what you're saying freeberg correctly They watched all this money being made by those otas They watched where they got their data from then they bought their data source and then they decided You know what? We won't take your cost per click money. We'll just take your entire business I don't know. So let me just put let me just say it another way. What's best for consumers? So does a consumer because what happens a lot in online the dictatorships? I guess that don't want to make money In online advertising, there are a lot of these ad arbitrage businesses is one way to think about it where um, You know a service provider will pay for ads on google to get traffic The ads will come to their site and then they will either make money on ads or you know Kind of sell that consumer or in another way, right? And so that's effectively what the otas were is they were they became Intermediaries online search and intermediaries that were arbitraging google's ad costs versus what they could get paid for the consumer And so google to look at this and they're like wait a second We're only capturing half the pie and consumers don't want to have to click through three websites to buy a flight or buy a hotel And by the way if they did they would keep doing it So why don't we just give them the end result right up front and then consumers will be happier the less time they have to Spend clicking through sites and looking at other shitty ads the happier they'll be and the product just works incredibly well consumers consumers lives less arduous While building a power base that then could make their lives miserable I'll say what I think lina kahn is saying though is you can't just look at the short term interests of consumers You got to look at their long term interest What's in the long term interest of consumers is to have competition in the short term? These giant monopolies can engage in predatory pricing to lower the cost for consumers And so just looking at the price on a short term basis isn't enough And they can trick people to giving them something else that they don't know to be valuable So in the case of these You know a lot of these companies what are they doing? They're tricking them to get enormous amounts of user information Yep, personal information user generated content and they get nothing for it And then on the back of that if you're able to build a trillion look at look at the value that youtube has generated um economic value and then try to figure out how much of that value is really shared With the creator community inside of youtube.

I'm guessing it's less than 50 basis points Well, I just want to percent a revenue. Yeah, but you're saying downstream with all that data Google's making a massive amount of money I just want to if you impute the value of all of the pii that google basically gets Personally identifiable information all the cookies that they drop all that information and you equate it to an economic enterprise value Not necessarily your the revenue like a discounted cash flow over 20 years You would be in the trillions and trillions of dollars and then if you discounted the same 20 years of revenue share That they give to their content producers It will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars at best And so you're talking about an enormous tradeoff where google basically has um built You know a multi trillion dollar asset and has leaked away less than 10 or 15 percent of the value But that's an example where they are giving people something that they think is valuable But in return they're able to build something much much more valuable I just want to address like sax's point Which is the regulators are now going to start to think about the long term interest consumer over the short term interest of the consumer as effectively giving the regulatory throttle to elected officials And this means that you're now giving another throttle right another controlled joystick um To to folks that may not necessarily come from business Um that may not necessarily have the the appropriate background And that may have their own kind of political incentives and motivations to make decisions about what is right and what is wrong for consumers over the long term And ultimately those are going to be value judgments, right? There's no determinism here.

There's no right or wrong Um, they're going to be decisions based on the kind of opinion and nuance of of some elected people And so it is a very dangerous and kind of slippery slope to end up in this world Where the judgment of some regulator about what's best for consumers long term versus the cold hard facts Oh prices went up prices didn't you know But really saying well, this could affect you in the future in this way Starts to become kind of a really, you know scary and slippery slope Uh, if we kind of embrace this uh, this this new regulatory order.

All right moving on big news this week, uh, apple had a gag order It has been revealed Um, this is unbelievable. It's pretty crazy. Um, and uh, we we only have partial information here But the justice department subpoenaed apple in february of 2018 About an account that belonged to donald mcgann who obviously was the uh, trump's white house counsel at the time And obviously was part of the campaign. He is very famously Known for being interviewed by muller and at that this is the time period by the way We're talking about here in february of 2018 When muller was investigating manafort who of course, uh, was super corrupt and went to jail and then was suddenly pardoned Because they he was also involved in the campaign in 2016.

It's possible that this related to muller. It's unknown at this time Uh, many other folks were also caught up in this dragnet rod rosinstein was a second and it's um unclear if the fbi agents were investigating Uh, whether mcgann was the leaker uh, or not trump uh, had previously ordered mcgann The previous june to have the justice department remove muller which mcgann refused and threatened to resign and mcgann later Revealed that he had in fact leaked his resignation threat to the washington post Uh, according to the times disclosure that agents had collected data of the sitting white house council Uh, which they kept secret for years is extraordinary.

Go ahead sacks. Well, I just think you let's get all the facts out here I think you're missing some of the key facts So the the justice department under trump starts this investigation into leaks of classified information they're on a mull hunt effectively And they start uh making the they subpoena the doj subpoenas records from apple and it goes very broad And they end up subpoenaing the records not just of mcgann who's the white house council, which is very bizarre and curious So they'd be investigating their own white house council, but they also uh, well it was a leadership sacks Yes, but they're all they also subpoena records of adam schiff and swallwell and members the house intelligence committee And so you have now Um an accusation which is being breathlessly reported on cnn and ms and bc that here you had the trump administration Investigating its political enemies and using the subpoena power of the doj with apples Compliance to now spy on their political enemies that that those are some big jumps.

Those are some big jumps Yeah, and and that those are some big jumps because Um, according to prit bahara and some other folks who are in the industry Um, who who have done these actual subpoenas they could have been subpoenaing, you know one of maniforts, you know corrupt You know partners in crime And then those people he could have been talking to many people in the trump administration And then subsequently family members and others so he might have not been the target He could have been caught up in the metadata of other people So this might not be trump saying get me his iphone records.

It could be there's some dirty person They know they're dirty and that person had reached out to other people and they might have even done one more hop from it schmoth but I mean Okay, that's one version. Yeah, and then you know the other the other version which is important is You subpoena your own lawyer by going to apple getting Basically god knows what data associated with this man's account And then you know institutes a gag order on that company so that they can neither tell the person Until now when the gag order expired nor tell anybody else nor have any recourse to the extent that they think that this is illegitimate That to me smells really fishy And so, you know, like there are other mechanisms that that we know of like fizzle requests and other things that these big companies have to deal with all the time This at least the way that it's written and how it's been reported is something outside of the pale And so I think you have to deal with it with this question of like what the hell was going on over there Yeah, it does seem like they were going uh I mean, you know kindly maybe mole hunting more nefariously witch hunting um But they were trying to pin it on people and they may have used this blanket sort of deniable plausibility of the Russia, you know, Imbrolio but really what these guys were doing was they were investigating Anybody that they thought was a threat and that is a really scary thing to have in a democracy And then the fact that these big tech companies basically just turned it over and didn't have any recourse to protect the user or to inform the public Forget trump for a second.

I think we don't necessarily want that to be the precedent that holds going forward Yeah, and the interesting thing here is that Saks Jeff Sessions Rosenstein and bar all say they're unaware of this So what would be the charitable reason they were unaware of it or what would be the Nefarious reason or is that important at all because that's really strange Well, they would go after the White House counsel and adam schiff and those top three people would have no idea Are they lying? I mean what's next is the s c as you know, are we gonna basically go to a point where like, you know Every single every no, I mean like every single post that one makes on facebook is basically surveilled If you make an anonymous post on twitter, will you be tracked down? I remember like as much as everybody thinks there's anonymity on the internet there really isn't and you should just completely assume That you are Trackable are being tracked have been tracked.

Everything is in the wide open It's just a matter of whether it's disclosed to you or not or whether it's brought back to you or not So yeah, so look, I mean I agree with Tomas that this stinks and it's an invasion of people's civil liberties But I would not make it too partisan because The obama administration was engaging in similar activity back in 2013 And I don't think people realize this the there's an old saying in washington that the real scandal is what's legal And the fact of the matter is that what the trump administration did was certainly suspicious and it might have been politically motivated We don't know but it was legal the doj convened a federal grand jury got these Got these subpoenas present them to apple and got this information And in a similar way back in 2013 the obama administration did something similar.

It's quite extraordinary They subpoenaed the records of the ap they for they for two months They got the records of reporters And five branches of the ap and all their mobile records and they were on a Moll hunt to try and find leakers of classified information So the trump administration basically did exactly what the obama administration did the only new wrinkle Is that they'd only went after reporters. They actually Assapeated records of members you're missing one huge. You're missing you're missing one huge difference Trump was under investigation Uh for espionage and treason at the time.

So it is slightly different. Um obama I I don't think it's that different in the sense that Trump used powers that were pioneered by the obama administration. They just took them. They just took them Well one little step further in addition to that sacks in addition to that Um when obama did it all the top brass at the department of justice were aware of this and in this case You have three people who are running the department of justice. The obama administration all claiming they don't know no In 2013 there's a new york times article on this i'm going to post on the in the show notes but It said that went went first of all the ap was not informed about the subpoenas until a number of months later So it was a secret Seizure of records same thing here with the gag order And so you have people being investigated.

They don't even know they're being investigated Investigated they can't even get a lawyer spun up to oppose the invasion of their rights I agree with you, but the attorney general knew about that Maybe the attorney general did but the white house claims that it didn't know so in any event I mean look what we I my view on this is that we shouldn't try to make this too partisan What we have here is an opportunity to hopefully get some bipartisan legislation to fix the issue and I think the fix should be this that When you Investigate somebody when you subpoena records from a big tech company you have to notify them You should not be able to do that secretly because the fact of the matter is that apple and these other big tech companies don't have an incentive to oppose the subpoena they're not your lawyer And actually brad smith the president of microsoft had a great op ed in the washington post that we should post That we should put in the show notes where he said these secret gag orders must stop He said that in the old way of the government subpoenaing records is that you would have Essentially offline records you'd have a file cabinet and the government would come with a search warrant That present the search warrant to you and then you could get a lawyer to oppose it Well, they don't do that anymore because your records aren't in a file cabinet somewhere They're in the cloud and so now they don't even go to the person who's being investigated They just go to a big tech company seize the records and then put a gag order on top of it So you don't even know you're being investigated.

That's the part of it that's by the way It's even more pernicious than that sacks because to Combine this with the previous story What incentive does apple have to say to an administration that could break them up? We're not going to cooperate Of course zero zero incentive They are not your agent in this and here's the thing those are your records They're in the cloud, but they're your records in every other private context. We say those records belong to you not to big tech So why are there not apples? This is why apples moving everything to your phone Right, but just this point.

Why should the government be able to do an n round around you the target of the investigation? Go to big tech get your records because they're not your records Well, first of all, they're not your records these companies tricked all of us By giving it to us for free so that we gave them all of our content They are fair point. Not just that they are not just the custodian. They are the trustee of our content And it's a huge distinction in what they're allowed to do and Jason brings up an incredible point But just which is that of course they're now incentivized to have a backdoor and Live under a gag order because they're their defense In a back room is you guys, you know when when in the light Somebody says we should break you up in the dark.

They can say guys come on. We got a backdoor You just come in gag order us give us what you will give you what you want You want a honeypot, right? You don't want this thing all over the internet And can you imagine how credible david that is to your point? Because that is a body of Concentrating power that I think is very scary in fairness to apple freedberg They have locked down the phone and they've moved all of this information from the cloud or they're starting this process and saying We're going to keep some amount of the data encrypted on your phone And of course with the san bernadito shooting they refused In a terror reshooting a known terror shooting to not give a backdoor Um, well, that's a crazy standard.

It's like, you know what? Okay. There was a san bernadino shooter and they were like, nope Sorry, that's a bridge too far. But you know don McGahn and basically like, you know Political espionage they're like here you go. I don't know. I don't know how do you make these decisions? Let me ask you guys a question. Go ahead free bird. Would you be could you see yourself Thriving in a world Where all of your information was completely publicly available But also all of everyone else's information was completely publicly available. Yes Oh, everybody has all their nudes on the web is what you're saying everyone Everyone there's a there's a there's a book by steven baxter called the light of other days It's one of my favorite sci fi books.

I sent it out to all of my investors this last We do like a book thing every year And I reread it recently But the whole point of the book is that there's like a wormhole technology that they discover and they can figure out how to like look In you can boot up your computer and look in anywhere and see anything and hear anything you want And so all of a sudden society has to transform under this kind of new regime of hyper transparency Where all information about everything is completely available But I think the the fear and the concern that we innately have With respect to loss of privacy is that there's a centralized or controlled power that has that information But what if there was a world that that you evolved to where all of that information is generally available quite broadly And I'm not advocating for this by the way I'm just pointing out that like the sensitivity we have is about our information being concentrated in the hands of either a government or a business um and I think you have to kind of accept the fact that more information is being generated about each of us every day than was being generated by us a few weeks ago or months ago or years ago Basically everybody in a everybody's detrumah and everybody's detrumah and show is what you're saying Well in a geometrically growing way Information which we're calling pii or whatever is being generated about us And I think the genie's out of the bottle Meaning like the the cost of sensors the access to digital the digital age and what it brings to us from a benefit perspective Is creating information about us and a footprint about us that I don't think we ever kind of contemplated But as that happens the question is where does that information go? Can you put that genie back in the bottle? And I think there's a there's a big philosophical point which is like if you try and put the genie back in the bottle You're really just trying to fight Information wants to be free information wants to grow.

What's the name of the book? You were talking about there the light of other days by steven baxter and arthur c clark helped write it But the book is most interesting about the philosophical implications of a world where all information is completely freely available Trans and anyone yeah completely transparent And so like do we see ourselves because I think there's two paths one is you fight this and you fight it and you fight it every Which way which is I want my pii locked up. I don't want anyone having access to it yada yada yada You'll either see a diminishment of services or you will see the other one is you do a Or you'll see a selfie on twitter where you take a shirt off or you'll see this concentration of power Where we all kind of freak out where the government or or some business has all of our information The other path is a path that society starts to recognize that this information is out there There is you know, whatever it is.

It's not just about pii here. This is about due process This is about our fifth amendment right to due process. You have the government secretly investigating people They could never do this if they had to present you with a search warrant They are doing an n run around that process by going to big tech just to put some numbers on this big tech is getting something like 400 subpoenas a week for people's records. They only oppose 4 percent of them Why they have no incentive to oppose them? How many of those are you should be able to send your you know how many are those a secret or not? We don't know how many of them have a gag order.

They are required to tell The target what happened, but not if there's a gag order attached to it We don't know how many have a gag order You should have the right to send your own lawyer to oppose the request not to depend on big tech for it If you want to see an amazing movie the lives of others, uh, which is about The state security service in east berlin germany uh, also known as the stasi and the impact of Literally in your apartment building. There are three people spying on the other 10 people And they're the postman and you know the housewife and the teacher and they're all tapped and secretly recording to each other It leads to chaos and bad feelings and obviously when east berlin When the wall came down all of this came out and it was really dark and crazy Yeah, I mean look, let me connect this to the censorship issue actually because in my view They're both very similar civil liberties issues, which is in the case of the censorship issue You have the government doing an end run around the first amendment By demanding that big tech companies engage in censorship that the government itself could not do You have something very similar taking place here with these records.

The government is demanding secrecy About its seizure of records. They're imposing that on big tech. They're making big tech do its dirty work for them They could never do that, uh, directly if they had to go to the target of the investigation and ask for their and and subpoena the records that way So what you have here is a case where we know only needs to be protected against the power of big tech We need to be protected against the power of government usurping The powers of big tech to engage in you know behavior they couldn't otherwise Engage in and let's be honest big tech and the government are overlapping and Inca hoots or they're in some yeah, they're in some really crazy dance.

The money is flowing freely from Lobbyists and it's a very very complicated relationship. It's a very complicated relationship All right seven day average for coveted debts is now at 332 finding cases of people who have had coveted Is now becoming like almost shocking. I don't know if you guys saw but the point guard chris paul Who is having an incredibly winning season the NBA? He basically got coveted They said he was vaccinated. So it could be a mild case, but he's been Pulled out indefinitely and he's about to play in the western conference final. So it's pretty crazy and freeberg obviously California's opened up after 15 months and we were the first to shut down the last open up and we were hit the least I think of any state or amongst the least of any We were certainly the least of any large state And you're being asked To still wear a mask at your office I'm also being asked to take off my shoes when I get on an airplane Yeah 20 years later and yeah, I don't think al Qaeda exists anymore Uh, yeah, maybe some parts of it explain what's happening to you in the presidio, which is a lovely state park uh here in California My office in the presidio in california san francisco county and the federal government have all removed mask mandates But our our landlord has determined in their judgment that everyone should still wear a mask to go to work And so to go into my rented office in work.

I have to wear a mask Um, and I think it's it's an issue for a lot of people who like those people at um I've been probably a couple restaurants this week and you know, you go to some restaurants and everyone's just chilling The employees are not wearing masks. There's other restaurants where they're being told they have to keep wearing masks by their manager or their boss And so this brings up this big question, which is like we've now got the kind of Psychic shadow of covet that that's gonna it's gonna it's gonna cast a very long shadow I think you predicted it you predicted it and um, and so people that that are in power Want to continue to kind of impress upon, you know, whatever, you know employees or tenants or what have you they might have In whatever they deem their judgment to be which is obviously in many cases an under informed uninformed non scientific and A non mandated judgment about effectively what people should have to wear So if the threat or the risk has been removed and all of the health officials and all of the government agencies are saying The threat has been removed, you no longer need to kind of wear masks But your boss or your manager or your landlord tells you you have to wear a mask to conduct your business or to go to work Um, you know, it's gonna bring up this whole series of challenges and questions I foresee for the next couple of months at least and maybe for several years about what's fair and what's right And and there will always be the safety argument to be made on the other side So it's very hard to argue against that and oh well the inconvenience is just a mask It's not a big deal But for you know a number of people to to now kind of be told, you know What to do and what to wear it'll take a year to sort all these things out because they'll all get Prosecuted or not prosecuted but litigated And they're going to go to court.

They will get rid of it for sure. There will be lawsuits on this And and what's going to happen is that you're going to basically have again jason back to that example of the the bakery in colorado Um, private institutions will be allowed some level Of independence in establishing, um, you know, certain employee guidelines and so on exactly and you you'll have to conform to those and Um, it is what it is. I mean, I I was very strange in austin in terms of these Covid dead enders who just will not let it go I'm in austin where nobody is wearing a mask and then there were like I went into lulu lemon and They like two people charged me with masks in hand And they were like you have to wear a mask and I was like do I and they're like, yes, it's our policy I was like fine.

I'll put it on. I don't care. You know, no big deal This thing this thing has really fried a bunch of people's brains. I mean, it's crazy I mean, it's basically like you've taken an entire group of folks and kidnapped them And kidnapped them essentially It's incredible. No, everyone's been Everyone's been held hostage, you know in a prison for the last year And so you've kind of accepted that this is the new reality. I got to wear a mask. I got to wear gloves Um, and you know, it's the similar sort of shift in reality that I think was needed going into this Where people didn't believe what it was and now it's hard for them to believe what it's become Well, we we we flagged this human nature.

Yeah. Yeah, we we flagged on this pot a few months ago the threat of zeroism Yeah, which is that we wouldn't let you know all the special rules and restrictions lift until There were zero cases of covet and we all know that's never gonna happen COVID will always be around in the background and just to add a layer to what's happening here in california is yeah on june 15th, we lifted the restrictions But governor Newsom has not given up his emergency powers and he's he says he will keep them until covet's been extinguished so he's now embraced zeroism on behalf of uh, the sort of authoritarianism yeah, and you know, so we've got this like golden state Caesar and now I What's interesting is I don't think this is just because he's a tyrant although he's certainly been heavy handed I think it's because that the I think it's more about corruption than ideology because federal funds Emergency funds from the federal government keep flowing to the state as long as we have a state of emergency And so the longer he keeps this thing going the more money He gets from the federal government that he can then use in this recall year to pay people off And so we've already seen he's been buying every vote.

He can right? He gave 600 bucks to everyone making under 35 000 He's forgiving all the traffic fines and parking tickets. He's doing this this lottery ticket thing for getting the vaccine and so he just wants to keep the the um, The gravy train from washington's It's going to california even though we have a surplus never wasted. It's what government governor chimoff would have done I mean it reminds me of 9 11 where people were just like hey, we can keep this gravy train No, I mean like 9 11 is the perfect kind of psychic, you know scenario You know replaying itself with covet there are behavioral changes that have lasted forever There are regulatory changes this you know department of homeland security I mean you go through the amount of money that gets spent by the tsa every year And the qualified risk and the qualified benefit Completely unquantified right like the amount of money that flows into these programs because you can make the the subjective statement There is a threat.

There is risk therefore spend infinite amounts of money right like it's because because you never kind of put Pen to paper and say what is the risk? What is the probability? What is the severity of loss and therefore let's make a value judgment about how much we should spend to protect against that downside And we're now doing the same thing with covet. We're not having a conversation about how many cases How many what's the risk should we really still be spending billions of dollars of state funding? To continue to protect a state where 70 percent of people are vaccinated and we and we have a massive surplus And we're still giving people money Who may or may not need it and we're doing it indiscriminately speaking of discussions and hard topics and being able to have them YouTube which kicked off a ton of people on the platform for talking about things that were not approved by the who Has taken professor brett Weinstein's podcast down because he had a very reasonable discussion About iver mectin and its efficacy or lack of efficacy.

This is a doctor a phd talking to an md Um and the video was removed apple did not remove. It's really it's really scary this episode These people should not be the gatekeepers of the truth. They have no idea what the truth is Let's talk about the the john steward appearance on steve. Well, that's what i was about to don't tell this which is Yeah, he killed he killed on steve and colbert But the things he was saying about the lab leak would not have been allowed on youtube If it was three months ago that you would have been removed for it even as a comedian the performance was amazing He basically says You know the wuhan Covid lab is where the wuhan, you know, uh, no the disease is named after the lab So where is he's named after the lab? You know, where do you think it came from was like a panel in You know mated with a bat.

I mean this is and he goes on this whole diatribe. It's incredibly funny Yes, but then at the end of it Well, I had two takeaways. I don't know if you guys felt this at first. I was like I had john steward's a little unhinged here Like I mean there was a part of it that was funny and then there was a part of it Which is like wow john steward's been trapped indoors a little too long for 15 months. Yeah Yeah, so I thought that as well to be honest, but then the second thing which I saw on twitter was all these people reminding Uh anybody who saw the tweet that this exact content would have not been allowed On big tech platforms Were it said three or six months ago? And I was like wow, this is this is really nuts meaning it takes a left leaning smart funny Idiot to say something that our if the if the right if the right would have said it would have just been instantly banished and That's like that's kind of crazy.

Yeah The great was I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to science science has in many ways helped ease the suffering of this pandemic Uh, which was more than likely caused by science Yeah, it was a funny line where he said something like uh, if there was an outbreak of chocolate goodness in hercy pennsylvania Perseverance, it wouldn't be because you know, whatever the pangolin kissed a bat. It's because there's a fucking chocolate factory there Like I don't know maybe a steam shovel mated with a cocoa bean It's a fucking chocolate factory He was so funny he's so he's so funny.

So I agree it's from us takeaways I mean this was Great example of censorship run amok at these big tech companies but the other thing I saw that was really interesting was Stephen Colbert lose control of his audience and You know stewart killed on that show, but you could see Stephen Colbert was I think visibly nervous very uncomfortable Yeah, very very uncomfortable. He did not know what was coming and he was trying to and when when when john stewart kept pushing this He was like, well, uh, he's trying to qualify. Well, so what you're saying is now that falchi has said this might be a possibility You're saying it might be a possibility and john stewart was having none of it.

He ran right over that said no The name is the same. It's obvious come on And yeah, well Colbert kept challenging him. I don't know if you saw this part where he said hey, listen Is it possible that they have a lab in wuhan to study the coronavirus disease because wuhan there are a lot of novel Coronavirus diseases because it's a big bat population and then stewart is like no i'm not standing for that He goes I totally understand It's the local specialty and it's the only place to find bats you won't find bats anywhere else Oh, wait, austin texas has thousands of the flat of a cave every night at dusk And he wouldn't let it go.

So it's just great watching it was it was a reminder frankly of how funny Both john stewart and steven colbert were about 15 years ago and i frankly I don't think steven colbert is funny anymore because no because he's got to keep his job He's carrying water. He's also too woke and yeah, yes He's become very polemical and and what stewart reminded us is that That comedy is funny when it's making fun of the people who are pretentious and basically who aren't telling the truth and Stephen colbert has become so polemical that he's lost sight of the comedy and don stewart brought it back and i hope you know By the way, by the way colbert colbert had this element of satire which even stewart because stewart was in your face funny Whereas colbert was like subtle and dry and you had to think about it.

There was layered Oh for sure. He's totally lost it totally totally lost well if you know, and then and then and then i thought stewart came out swinging hard I do think though it sacks you have to agree Did it seem to you though like stewart had not like he just needed more human to human interaction? He was the cage tiger man. He was the cage tiger. They let him out He was like taking it out going to off. Absolutely It was the funniest thing john stewart's done in many years and and the reason is because He connected with the fact that here is this obvious thing that we're not allowed to say And that is what comics should be doing.

Yes put a light on that I mean if comedy is tragedy plus time I think that this is a great moment for us to Reflect on like I think we're going to go back to normal pretty quick Um, if you remember after 9 11, there was this idea that comedy was over forever You were not going to be able to make fun of things and that this was the end of satire people were this is you know Um a bridge too far etc. And I think we're back. We're back and that's it You know, we can joke about the coronavirus.

We can talk about it We don't need to censor people for having an opinion. We're all adults here um, you know the idea that You know, we have to take down people's tweets because they have some crazy theory or put a label on them Like we went a little crazy during the pandemic Um and tried to stifle discussions for what reason? Exactly like when we look back on this it's going to look really strange that we demanded that we put labels on people questioning or having a debate including doctors doctors were not allowed to debate to the public on youtube or twitter about Uh, what was the drug that trump kept promoting? Hydroxychloroquine Chloroquine like remember that whole chloroquine.

I think this uh, ivermectin or whatever it is It's just triggering people because it feels like that last drug Which is a drug that may or may not work to slow down the progression of covid But anyway, this is all over if you haven't gotten your goddamn vaccine. Please get it stop denying science Stop denying science and climate change climate change is not real Oh my god, the youtube just canceled our account. Jamal, what are you doing? You can't say that Science we we talk about science as if science is a definitive answer to a question It's a process a process by which you come to answers you test them and look hydroxychloroquine may have been completely wrong But let the debate happen the answers came out anyway I'll tell you a fundamental premise of science is to challenge assumptions and so when you challenge um Uh an existing hypothesis or uh kind of an existing thing that we hold to be true You are engaging in science and the rigorous debate around what works and what doesn't work Was notably absent over the past year because everything became about the political truth You're either true or you're false based on your political orientation and we reduced everything down to kind of this one Identity politics this one dimensional framework, which we have a tendency party politics.

Let me just point this out to you guys I was gonna mention this a few weeks ago, but like think about every conversation you have how um Comment it is now to immediately think about what the person on the other side that you're talking to just said And then trying to put them on a blue or red spectrum It's it's it's how we've all kind of been reprogrammed over the past decade or so Where it used to be about the topic itself and the objective truth finding or the or the specifics of what we're talking about And now it's become about you immediately try and resolve them to being conservative or or not Red or blue trump or not purple And so every conversation you kind of try and orient around that simple ridiculous one dimensional framework And it's a complete loss of the discovery of objective truth in all matters in life And all matters in that affect all of us.

Um, and it's uh, it's really quite uh stark and sad This is why we need a new political party. The reason party. I think it's less about that I think it's more about everyone just reorienting themselves when you have a conversation Just notice yourself doing it and then recognize that maybe that's not the way to make a decision about the conversation Or about having an opinion or a point of view But have an opinion or a point of view about the topic itself Not about the orientation of the topic on a on a single dimensional spectrum And then layer identity politics into that So not only your politics, but your gender your race or sexual preference The color of your skin and now how is anybody supposed to have a reasonable argument when I have to process like oh Chimots from You know Sri Lanka, but he went through Canada and he worked for I mean, it's just it's so reductive that no one gets It's so it's so reductive that no one gets to have an identity anymore Right because we we are all complex and all issues are complex and they are all nuanced And when you reduce everything down to kind of this one dimensional framework You lose any ability to have depth to have nuance to have Said another way the issues are complex enough We don't have to put identity politics or political, you know leanings on top of it All right, so we had the worst fire season in California ever last year Obviously as Chimots said global warming is a conspiracy um by the Chinese uh as per your guide trump uh sacks and uh What's happening? There is climate change in Switzerland.

There is a center called the center for climate change There is a reason that there's climate change in switzerland. It's coming from that lab. Ah the center did it Look at the side It says climate change on the building they're getting paid to propagate this conspiracy theory Yeah, all right, so it's it's going to be the worst. So we are we well we are at risk more than ever, right? So we're entering june. So as of june 1st the california snowpack is down to zero percent of normal That's never happened before so it's the lowest it's ever been there.

There is absolutely like no snowpack in the entire sierra in the entire state 40 percent of the state is in a state of extreme drought right now We've had 16 000 acres burn as of a few weeks ago up from 3600 during the same time period the same day of the year last year um and so the the tinder is there now remember Uh last year was the highest um Uh california has ever seen we burned four million acres Uh last year california has about 33 million acres of farmland of forest land representing about a third of our total land size in the state Um, you know 60 of that land is federal 40.

It's private um and so the the big kind of variable drivers this year are going to be um, you know A wind and heat and we're already seeing a few heat waves, but it's the wind that kind of kicks these things off But the tinder is there right so like the state is dry um the uh The snowpack is gone. We're on severe water restrictions in a lot of counties throughout the state Um, it's worth I think talking about the carbon effect, you know last year Um based on the forest that burnt in california Uh, we released about one and a half times as much carbon into the atmosphere from our forest fires as we did from cars burning fossil fuels in the state um and so Wow, so here's some statistics for you guys, which I think are just worth highlighting There's about two billion metric tons of carbon stored in california forest land, which is about 60 tons per acre um, so there's about nine million new tons of carbon sequestered per uh in california by our forest land per year When there's a fire We release about 10 tons per acre so about one sixth of the of the carbon in that in that forest land The rest of the carbon doesn't burn up So remember when there's a forest fire typically the outside of the tree burns the whole thing doesn't burn to ash And so a forest fire can actually if you look at the longitudinal kind of effect of it burning forests can actually preserve The carbon sequestration activity versus, you know, just removing forests or removing trees Um, and so there is to some extent, um, you know an effort that has been shut down several times Which is to do these kind of controlled burns through the state, but it's met with such resistance Uh, given that it's so controversial.

No one wants to have smoke in their in their neighborhood It shouldn't be it shouldn't be controversial The problem is you can't present simple data and have people have a logical conversation about and the cost per acre to clear land and Farm to forest land in california is It ranges depending on the complexity of the land, but it's somewhere between 50 and $1,000 So call it a couple hundred dollars per acre So you can very quickly kind of do the math on a carbon credit basis chumot. So it's about 40 bucks per ton Uh for for carbon credit today So you're actually, you know, you can kind of preserve about 400 dollars per ton per ton by not putting carbon into the atmosphere And if you can actually manage farmland forest land clearance and forest land preservation Uh from fire at a cost of 400 or less and there was an active carbon credit market You should be able to cover the cost of managing that forest land back But we're here's the incredibly high risk this year It doesn't mean that we're necessarily going to have a fire because weather is the key driver The weather is highly variable and we need wind we need wind and we need a heat wave with wind and then there will be fires But then what do they do when the when the wind kicks up right now the electric company turns off power In california because they don't want to be blamed when a power line goes down and starts a fire So we have regular moments.

This is not just a california. We just lose power Yeah, this is not just a california problem. I know everyone wants to beat up on california But like the whole western us go look at google maps. You'll see how much green stuff there is on google maps It's green up and down the western half of the u.s. Friedberg. It was trump right that um raking up the forests to put it in layman's terms or simple terms is an actual thing that helps 60 of forest land in california is federal land And it was the federal government's responsibility to manage that that cost down to manage that risk down What is the incentive? What is the motivation? You know, what are the key drivers? Those are obviously it does work to clear it though It theoretically when you reduce the amount of tinder you will reduce the risk of a burn, right? And so the cost but the cost of doing so as we mentioned it's probably a couple hundred dollars per acre And so who's gonna let's say you want to do that on five million acres, you know, wouldn't this create a bunch of jobs? Oh wait, we're paying people to stay home Yeah, like it would create a ton of jobs.

I mean, I hate to be like that guy, but like could we $35 an hour jobs for people I've heard scuttle, but that nuisance is so worried about fire season that they're going to try and accelerate the recall election So it happens before there was you know, the conventional system the conventional wisdom He's so smart If Tramont did it it would be strategic The conventional wisdom was that you'd want to wait as long as possible to do the recall because the longer you wait The longer you get the rebound of the economy from covid, right? But now they're talking about accelerating it to beat fire season because it's looking really bad And free works like that that we needed much more aggressive forest management It's not just climate change.

It's also forest management. We don't do it in california anymore And so I think we're we are in for a really hellish fire season We are going to have a terrible we're going to have a terrible fire season Um, there's going to be brownouts probably throughout a lot of the western states What played out in texas that affected folks a few months ago? I think will some version of that will happen Um in many places in the u.s. This is and it's all roughly avoidable And the critical principal act is here is the progressive left They need to marry They're disdain for climate change And they're disdain for Uh, the things that need to happen to prevent it because right now these two things for them are just like it's Cataclysmically not possible Um for us to agree on for example as freedberg says a controlled burn program as a mechanism of sort of like fighting climate change or you know investing more in the The greenification of the economy so that we can actually eliminate the use of a lot of these non sustainable energy sources all these things Basically just come down to a group of individuals Deciding that they can both have an opinion on something as important as climate change But then are also willing to then go and act right now they won't until they do Um, it's just going to spill over everywhere It's going to be a very bad fire season and the only reason I know that it is is that every year before it has been Every single year has gotten warmer.

It's not need to be a genius here better. Yes By the way, let me just correct a statistic. I said because the statistic I gave was a few weeks ago Um, but as of today, we are actually at the average The historical average in terms of number of acres that are burnt in california as we have seen historically I will also say that you know close to one sixth of um california's Forest land burnt last year So there is a tremendous amount of tinder that has been removed from the risk equation And we typically burn about a million acres a year.

I think we burnt like four million last year a little over four million last year So, you know as you look at the the cumulative kind of reduction of burnable acres We're actually the good thing that's going on is we're actually at a lower risk scenario going into this year in terms of total amount of tinder The risk of the tinder catching is higher because it's drier NASA but when you add this all up, there's certainly a high probability of a bad fire season But there could be a scenario here where we end up with less than a million acres again There's zero scenario that's going to happen.

NASA publishes temperature studies. They do measured measurements of how Much warming there is in the earth Last year we set yet another record. It was the seventh year in a row where it was Warmer than all the previous successive years. It's just going in the same place I mean and so if we're all of a sudden supposed to bet That a trend that has effectively been reliable for the last decade is going to turn I'm not sure that that's a bet you'd want to make or that the winds is not going to blow It's a stupid bet.

There's no reason to make that bet. I mean, this is like betting on a one outer We need we need we need the left to take control of this issue and solve it Get ready for Martian skies over California, I mean literally I'm thinking about an escape plan from California I mean and I am putting a generator in this month. I bought six new air filters, you know, like beautiful That's not that's not good enough Well, I have my house is totally sealed and I have the air purifiers in I have a built in air purifier of the house And I have six portable ones in each every bedroom in my Are you coming back in august? Uh in at the end of august, but by the way, let me let me tell you where it really the rubber meets the road Uh, just again, I'm speaking to the progressive left.

They care apparently so much About minorities. I just want to make sure you guys understand that, you know air quality Disproportionately affects minorities. Why? Because we are not not me anymore But you know minorities are the ones that typically live near industrial output near transportation throughways and when thoroughfares Yeah, it is it is statistically proven that blacks brown other minority people are the worst people to suffer from respiratory diseases And airborne illnesses and these are things that are that are happening today So again, I want to go back to the same group of individuals who apparently believe in climate change But don't believe in nuclear.

They don't believe in control burns. They believe in inequality But they don't want to do what's necessary to regulate a mission. What are we doing guys? Just at some point do the job do the job. I think do your fucking job I What you're saying is correct ramath, but I think it's a sad statement about the progressive left that the only way to Reach them through an argument is to argue for that there's a disparate impact on a minority the reality is all Americans Yes, exactly exactly. It's it's bad. Red pill me give me those red pills.

Come on Come on sacks. You're holding out on me. No, but but ramath but ramath understands that audience He is making the argument they're going to respond to but the argument that they and everyone should be responding to is humanity is bad for everybody the planet all humans exactly What are you guys going to do for fire season? Do you actually I'm thinking about renting a house? Like I rented a house in Chicago and like Michigan last year and I went there and it was a great escape for a month To get away from fire season.

I don't I don't I'm very scared to be in california during all of this to be completely honest with you I don't just want to be there. Um, yeah, I'm out I'm gonna try to figure out some come back in late of august and hopefully everything is calmed down by then Although it won't because it gets very very hot at the end of august September was the heart of it. It's typically the heart of it. It's hard of it Jake how do you think you're gonna go to miami or austin or something? you know, I I I went back to austin for a wedding and uh, I met the governor, um, and Don't care.

You went this wedding and you met Oh You gotta beep that out you went to swearing about the governor. Yes. Um, and Going to austin in 2021 is like when I would come to san francisco and go to the battery in 2003 and sacks 2013 and sacks would say, why don't you live here? There's so much going on in san francisco come to san francisco and I did Uh, and I I got the last five years of the peak but uh, austin very appealing to me and then I've been looking at beach houses in, um, miami and I'm 50 of the way there folks.

Oh my god. I mean the fact that you can now buy a beach house. I mean God bless america America 71 three year average I had a 71 three year average in high school In 1150 on my sates and I'm gonna buy a beach house and I forgot that I convinced you to move up san francisco yet another way in which I Have contributed to the monster your career Towards absolutely absolutely.

I have to come I have to come on your show and red pill you And make sure that you're you're saying the truth and not getting too wrapped up in your trump derangement syndrome or whatever at the end of the day You know, we we are I think all of us working through Complex issues to free burg.

I really loved your contribution today about how complex these issues are And layering more complexity onto them of our identities our wealth You know our histories immigrants not whatever politics These issues are so hard and in some ways also so easy with technology and world class execution That the world needs to have more reasonable conversations And I think that what we've demonstrated here is that four friends can have reasonable discussions and laugh about life and enjoy life And that should be for everybody listening. That's what sam said in her note to us, which was very heartwarming.

So thank you Yeah, that was great. Yeah, I mean, love you guys. Love you sacks Must download new directions to escape forest fires Love love program Love L ove querying dictionary a feeling of affection for another entity or human Like I like playing video games till 2 a.m. And my dog Can I say it to a very similar to coding or? problem solving using my computer do I Hp 17b Oh sub routine overheating must play chess with peter teal and stop saying I love you to jacob My shirt was so expensive But yet so thin I put on yet another shirt I had to pump it out for the pod I'm lucky because I've gained 15 pounds.

I just do make up for it with a $1,200. How do I look with four colors for you? Say no, it's more two but also two chins. So two colors make up for my double chin Two shirts are better than one Two shirts are better than one. What? Okay, twice as good. Sacks is adding shirts to masses. We'll see you all next time. Love you guys We'll let your winners ride Rainman David sacks And it said we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy I love you Besties are gone We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow You're
