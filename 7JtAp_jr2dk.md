You weren't at this rally He was in quote unquote Miami Right, I think he's in the Miami Hilton On Pennsylvania Avenue right now That he put up that fake Miami background But the truth is Let's be honest here Trump came out at 10am And had a rally Jason, can we just take a start back for a second Doesn't David SACs look like Elliot Gould in Ocean's Eleven right now He's so Elliot Gould He is a Silver Fox and are you I mean you were very public about Being in Miami over the new year You took your town to Miami and we see this background So We can assume that dictators in his Pool house Poker room, we know that Freeberg's In a Ritz Colton somewhere based on the Furniture, he's in his Ritz Colton Office And SACs, based on your background Are you in Miami right now? Yeah, I'm still here Okay, but David did you meet with The man or not I haven't, I actually met him I did meet him, I went to like a tech Event the other night and he was there Were you wearing masks at the tech event Or not? Were you wearing a mask? They were like No, no, no, I'll tell you There were masks indoors and then there was Like COVID testing inside and then You could graduate to the outdoor patio part where people generally Weren't wearing masks So were you in conversations with People with no masks on? Is that what you're saying? At this event? Yeah, but Everyone's been like COVID tested Like a zillion times and it was outdoors And you know, I'm willing To meet with people outdoors, you know, I generally Don't do it indoors, but I'm I've said that's my Policy starting several months ago Can we rewind To April with that photo of Saks where he was in the ski mask And the goggles and the helmet And the biohazard suit and like How things have changed, he's like I'll go to Miami and have a chat with someone Yeah, look, you could You could definitely Do how it started and how it's Going, split photo for But look, at the time You're like sharing a banana split with someone Like, you know On eBay and Alibaba buying Ventilators for his Home Triage Center Well, I mean We had people from the WHO saying In March that the Case fatality, the infection fatality rate Was like 7%, you know And the two big things we learned after That were number one, that there Was a huge distribution by Age, right, and so somebody under 50 without comorbidities had a much Much, much lower risk and then also The thing we learned is that the There's maybe a 10x difference between The infection fatality rate and the case fatality rate I mean, you guys know all this And so once we learned those things I mean You know, I think a rational person Takes things like that into account I changed my policy With respect to COVID, you know And now especially that we have You know, easy access to tests Which weren't available You can get tested before going into An event I have a question to add on to that Do you own A fur Chewbacca outfit And were you In Washington, DC Yesterday? With Warpaint On your nipples Do you have a podium? Do you have a neck to waist tattoo? Are you standing behind A podium? Let me hide the Viking horn so that I've got Scratch away here All right, listen Can we title yesterday's event National Lampoon Siege of the Capital I mean, it was like Animal House Like, you know There was a great tweet by somebody saying This was Like the storming of the Bastille As perpetrated by the cast of Animal House Right, totally And there was another great tweet saying The capital now appears to be Under the control of a man in a Viking Mask The best one The best one was I have lost all Respect for Nicholas Cage's ability To steal the US Constitution Apparently Whatever copies So let's just go through the chain of events here And it was absolutely Surreal because Trump literally went out To a mob of people And said I want you to march down Pennsylvania Avenue And show the GOP what it takes To have courage, etc.

Apparently told Trump That he was not going to go to bat For him in the ceremonial Process of counting the Votes and Lo and behold, you're watching This, you know, the objections going on To the electoral count And you see the secret Service come rushing in and it becomes a You know, very serious situation and when you watch some of the videos It is truly terrorizing that Thousands of people Overwhelmed the police And I guess I want to start with People's opinion on Trump's Copability In inciting What was very dangerous behavior Four people are dead So, you know, while we're joking about The cosplay outfits A woman who Was an ardent Trump supporter Who is a vet who did four tours From what I've read And I shared the video with you before And I'm sure you know as they broke into the building Was trying to breach another area Of the building and she's climbing through A window and gets shot Apparently by the secret service or the police And dies And so it's all fun and games Until four people are dead And now somebody's lost their Wife, daughter, sister Jason, I mean there could have been 400 dead, there could have been 4,000 Absolutely, I mean this could have become a shootout Of the okay crowd, I can't understand why The police showed the restraint they did I mean when you see them getting Surrounded, I don't know if you saw the one They didn't show restraint Jason, there was no police When you look at the amount of Security that's typically there And has been there For other situations And then you compare it to the amount of security Knowing for a month and a half that this was coming It's It just doesn't make any sense to me So I'm a little dumb founded That, you know, you couldn't have seen This Facebook group called You know, hashtag storm the capital Which had tens of thousands Maybe hundreds of thousands of members In there, plotting and scheming Selling merchandise called Storm the capital You know, these guys were wearing printed Sweatshirts that they had time to make And nobody knew about it And nobody thought to reinforce The security And barricade it and make sure that You couldn't go from the protest site To the cat, I mean It just seems like there's some level of complicity That needs to get found out here But there was an interview I saw With an ex DC police guy who said That I think folks were told to tamper down The police forces were told To tamper down on managing Crowds and protests and riots Following the controversy associated With BLM a few months ago And spraying folks with pepper spray And water and all the Physical techniques that were used Were so Outraging That there was just more of a systemic Concern about being too aggressive With protesters and as a result They went too far the other way It's not an unreasonable So it just happens to be Freedberg that When black people protested And brown people, they got the tear gas And beaten with Batons and then when the white people Storm the Capital in the same area They got Walked down the steps and exquered it out With a stern warning To not do it again.

I mean this is Hypocritical and insane I don't know why you have to go there Particularly It looked to me like What happened is that the Capitol Hill police Simply got completely overwhelmed You look at these, you know, giant This is a rally on the mall that turned into A mob Well, first it kind of turned into a tailgater Then it turned into a mob And then it turned into an insurrection It kind of stumbled forward into Progressive phases Of Of stupidity and disaster But it looked to me like The Capitol Hill police simply got overwhelmed They obviously were unprepared They were surprised, I think, by this And I saw a video of tons of tear gas Being used.

I saw people getting Tear gas like crazy and I think there was Reports this morning On Twitter that the whole area in front Of the Capitol there was covered in that Light film that remains after Tear gassing. So I don't think they were Really pulling punches too much And I also think that That there will be Prosecutions. I think that These people were captured on Video. There's a lot of talk on Twitter And everybody is in favor of finding out Who they are applying facial recognition And bringing charges So I think there will be a lot of charges Unlike, let's say, the BLM Protest this summer.

I don't remember anybody Getting charged based on video Of people riding or looting And then I think The final difference Actually with the BLM protests is that If you've watched Fox News at all in the last 24 hours The condemnation Of the storming of the Capitol of what happened Has been across the board Both right and left. Everybody across the Political spectrum has condemned it Nobody is apologizing For it. Nobody on the right Is looking for root causes To explain the reasons why it Happened. Everybody is just condemning It and saying that it should never have Happened and the people who did it Should be prosecuted.

And So I don't see any kid gloves Here being used You know, either physically or I'll tell you where I see the kid glove sacks is When you see officers being Waste up the steps Or taking selfies Which is one instance. I don't want to just say That's the only indicative thing. But when people Are breaking through windows And just kind of being let go They were obviously overwhelmed, but I'm surprised More people didn't get shot. Chamath Let's just tackle this head on In terms of the race issue I have a question for David Before I make my statement.

David Do you think that if this were Black and brown people Storming the capital Would there have been more or less than Four deaths? Honestly, I think it would have been the same. I just disagree. I disagree. I disagree. I really disagree. And I'll tell you why. I think you have the best of intentions wanting To think that way. But here's the way I see it. I see a president that basically Instigated A group of people who are fundamentally Disenfranchised. Let's face it. Like there Are a lot of very, very reasonable Republicans And a lot of very reasonable Democrats The fringes of both parties Are functionally, mentally retarded.

We know this. Okay? And so what you see are extreme On both sides Who are just completely lost And looking for any excuse And so you have a president In the tail end of his presidency An anonymous presidency Basically call them out Nobody who actually had a job Or anything to do could have a reason To show up. So you had all these people show up. It's a Wednesday. It's a Wednesday during the day. And what do you think happens? They're there. They're all frothed up. You know, Eric Trump frothing them up. Donald Trump Jr.

frothing them up. Trump frothing them up. Giuliani frothing them up. And all of a sudden, as you said, Stumbling into degrees of craziness And stupidity to storm the Capitol. And I just think to myself, how could a president Have a chance to be a president I just think to myself, how could a president Instigate this kind of action? Number one. The second thing I think about is When black Athletes Peacefully protested Something That they had the fundamental constitutional Right to protest In the president's eyes, they were sons of Bitches White people that stormed The fucking Capitol The people's house Were called patriots by the president's daughter Which he deleted And then were told And then were told that they were loved By the president himself To me, it's just an enormously stark contrast Of a double standard I think that beyond the persecutions of the people I actually feel very bad For the people that stormed the Capitol I feel like these are Folks that are on the fringes Who just need a vessel And Trump is a vessel That's the only way to mitigate them and runs away You know what I mean? He's a coward.

He's lost. These are lost people. That these guys commit the crime and now they're going to go to jail I feel like the culpability has to go all the way Back to Trump, to Holly, to Cruz These guys are the real scumbags In all of this. Freeberg, what are your thoughts on this? And then I'll go back to Sax and let him respond I don't think it's unreasonable to assume That this was a Black Lives Matter And it was Black people Involved or brown people involved In the same sorts of activities You saw yesterday that you would not see More shootings I don't think that's an unreasonable position to take Obviously I think there's this other circumstance Which is that event preceding this one As I mentioned, I saw an interview With a DC police Former police director of the police I forgot what his title was Where he highlighted that folks were Kind of instructed to stand down Following the BLM controversies So I think that's also kind of a reasonable point of view And is Trump What about the president's culpability? I think that's one issue that's going to have to be addressed Post And I think we have to figure out what life post Trump is going to be like Because this is a level of chaos That nobody, to Sax's point All people condemned There's a theory Which actually takes its origin from Hitler Where Hitler used this term, the big lie And the theory is That you can create political propaganda By saying something that's so outrageous It is so Improbable That people say there's no way this thing keeps getting said Over and over unless it's actually real And this is sort of Like the QAnon pedophile ring In the pizzeria That the election was stolen from you It is such an outrageous statement That It seems to people That it only has to be true Because it is such an insane thing And if it is It's so insane and I'm so incited By this thing So this is kind of a Acknowledged as being A political propaganda technique that goes back A long time, by the way, Hitler used it as a way To use it as almost like a double bluff To blame the Jews In Germany Which was An unfortunate kind of Origin of the term But the term is used a lot now In saying these sorts of events are ridiculous Now what's going to happen going forward I don't think big lies go away You can try and mute them on Twitter And mute them on Facebook or reddit But whether it's QAnon or whatever is next This is becoming kind of a standard form now Because of the way media has distributed Anyone can say a big lie And it gets a lot of listens And Trump is totally culpable for that He made some shit up He made a bunch of claims If you guys haven't seen Lindsey Graham's speech yesterday It is absolutely worth watching That he gave late last night And he's like, I asked for the Show me the 10 people That claimed that they voted And they were under 18 They gave me one They gave me zero And it goes on and on for a couple of minutes About how none of what was said About what happened in the election was true And it was all false And he's like, this is all just not true And so I think Trump is culpable For creating a falsehood And having a megaphone And there are certainly technology What about the inciting of violence That is, I think, where the rubber is going to meet the road Trump's going to be out of office in two weeks or less One way or the other Do you Saks, I want to give you the time To respond to the issue Of the double standard In terms of race and BLM And then also, do you Saks, if you're On Biden's team coming in Do you advise that you prosecute Trump or investigate Trump For this insurrection Yes or no? Okay, so just to tie off on the BLM issue I just, you know, I just Don't think that race is The issue here Chamath, look, I don't know at the end of the day What the fatalities would have been If it had been a BLM protest That went awry But I will stick to what I said before Which is, I predict that you will see more prosecutions Come out of this Of the people who are involved I'm talking about the people who stormed the Capitol Then we saw from all the BLM protests Over the summer, I mean, I don't remember Any prosecutions coming out Of videotape Of people being caught recorded looting and riding And I predict you will see more here And again, I think another difference Again, to the extent there's a double standard You know, I remember A lot of left wing news networks Calling the, the riding and looting The summer peaceful protests which they clearly were not You even had a book called Indefensive Looting And I don't hear anybody defending the storming of the Capitol Nobody on the right So, look, to the extent there's a double standard I don't know that it accrues to The BLM side of this, but look I think that's kind of beside the point and not the real issue here I mean, Jason, to your question of Is Trump responsible? Yes, I mean, clearly 100% Yes, because He is the one Who put forth this theory that The election was stolen And was constantly repeating it for the last two months Two months ago, right after the election There was an article published in the spectator Called Deplorables Don't Riot It was actually a pretty good op end You know, it was written by a conservative And the conservative's point was That You know, all these windows and shops have been boarded up In anticipation of potential Riding and looting with the election And all these conservatives were saying Well, who's do, you know, who are they afraid of? You know, not us, not the MAGA folks Well, and the theory was Deplorables don't, don't riot And, and the right Was, was proud of that two months ago And now we are seeing that, well, no The Deplorables are rioting Why, why is that? What, what changed Over the last two months? And what changed is the constant feeding To this group of people This idea, starting with Trump, but then perpetuated By, you know, different right wing media organizations And other politicians Who sort of were, you know Trying to curry favor with Trump They were constantly pushing Forward this idea that the election was stolen So that these people on the mall Who then riot and storm the Capitol Believe that the election was being stolen from them So, you know, ultimately that responsibility Goes, is Trump's So to be clear and reflecting back To you, you're saying Trump incited Sedation, is that the right word? Well Sedition? Sedition doesn't seem like the wrong, doesn't seem like The exact right word to me, I mean It was, it was certainly a riot Now, now did, now look, I mean You're talking about prosecuting a legal case You know, if you want to look at the legal standard For incitement, it has to be You know, provoking people to take an imminent lawless act Did he, did he I think, I think he If you want to see that this mob is a gun I think he loaded the gun He pointed in a certain direction, but did he Tell them to storm the Capitol? No, not specifically, I think therefore It would be a very hard case to Prosecute, but I think, you know, prosecuting him In a court of law is sort of Unnecessary and redundant, I mean I think that in the eyes of the public Politically, he is I think most people see that he's culpable Is that the end of his political career? I think he's disqualified himself From being a candidate You know, at a national level again I mean, if you look, again Could just go back two months ago Look at how much has changed Two months ago, just in the day or two after the election Trump had narrowly lost But there was talk of him Starting a new news network To rival Fox, there was talk about He could even be a candidate again in 2024 It was not off the table I think now it's clearly Off the table and you've seen It's probably because of the Georgia runoffs Which we should get to But again, the Republican candidates At least one of them had won That election two months ago and now they lost And that has a lot to do With Trump's antics in the meantime Of just feeding this constant You know, lie about the stolen election I think there's a really important question About, you know, sorry But is it worth prosecuting Trump Post fact? You know, does that do more harm Or good for the country as a whole? Certainly there'll be a lot of people that would get great satisfaction Of putting Trump in prison and a lot of people are calling for that But We really do need to question The, you know, the incredible divide In the nation and what's the best way to heal the divide The objective shouldn't be pursuing justice It should be about moving forward I'm not suggesting don't prosecute Trump But I think that it's worth it's worthy of noting that You know, there is Another way of framing this whole thing Which is what's the best thing to do going forward On the flip side, you could even make the case That one of the best things Joe Biden could do today Or tomorrow Is to announce a federal election Review commission To actually look into wrong doings At the state level with a bipartisan basis 100% right 100% 100% It's a slam dunk case anyway If Biden did that and he Embraced the notion that a lot of folks are really angry about And said I'm listening to you I'm hearing you, let me show you And at the same time they did not prosecute Trump And let him go off into the distance And do his own thing Maybe you start to kind of heal the rift a little bit But right now everyone's kind of inflamed And there is this like how do we prosecute him What do we do And we're just continuing to kind of escalate The dialogue And increase the rift So look, I think prosecuting Trump At this point, first of all, legally That might be a difficult case to prove Because of the need to prove That he Was trying to provoke An imminent lawless action If he had been at the barricades Pushing people forward, yes So I think legally it would be a tough case And I think it would be, like you said That he was necessarily divisive And partisan, I don't know why we need to go there I mean, at the end of the day Any politician's stock in trade Is their credibility and popularity And Trump has fundamentally Damaged the perception of him I think even among the right I have a huge issue with this and I'll tell you why It's because the folks That are now going to go to jail Were instigated By this guy And the folks that were there In many ways Were brought They were cajoled They were instigated To travel from Groomed to travel there To take the time out of their lives To basically then get fed This rhetoric and in a moment of Just crazy mob like mentality To act out at the behest Of the leader of the free world There has to be a consequence Not just to those people because These are not the person to prosecute To the extent that you are going to Put some of these people in jail It looks like we're going to and by the way Let's be honest, there is no inconceivable Way that these people get charged with a misdemeanor That's not going to stand And the worst perpetrators of this When they get put in jail will get put in jail For five to ten years minimum And so what are we going to do When we look at ourselves in the eye and say These poor Americans at the end of the day Who were instigated by this guy Yet again gets off scot free While hundreds of Americans Who were basically in a peak of craziness Fed by this guy Does something and goes to jail And you have hundreds of lives And hundreds of families ruined Even if we don't find a way To basically put Trump in jail for this I can 100% guarantee you I will bet a million bucks That now The southern district of New York Gloves off Every single state That can go after this guy Gloves off and To the extent that Joe Biden had any Incentive to basically let this Go away at the federal level Gloves off.

In my opinion I really really think something Let's say that folks do go after Trump What does that do if he gets Put in jail or he gets There's some criminal proceeding brought against him What does that do to the 50% of the nation That truly support him and truly care about him I don't The balance of justice versus unification How do we wait until I think we're talking about 25% of the country Whatever it is Whatever it is, obviously a big voting Block and a big block of the potential Block for the electoral power I think of the 70 million People that voted for Donald Trump I think there are Half of them Who would equally vote for A normal centrist candidate Mitt Romney, Nikki Halley Didn't necessarily believe in Donald Trump Then I think there's the other 35 million And I do think that there's a Spectrum of those 35 And I think that you probably lost 10 or 15 million of them After the events of yesterday Where they just threw their hands up in the air and said It would really only inflame 20 million is what you're saying Correct and I agree with And those 20 million people Are you know, sad to say Concentrated in about 10 states That don't functionally matter Economically or otherwise The balance of justice versus unification Certainly it sounds like you're saying Ways heavily towards justice More folks will benefit from seeing him Come to justice or with perceived justice Then it will be I think it will allow the Republican party To resenter itself, I think that's better for politics I think it's better for Governance, it's better for America I think it allows a lot of people To basically wake up out of this haze That they've been in for years and say Wow, wait a minute, enough Like I was on a really bad bender I did a couple things I really regret And I need to resenter myself How do you not find this turning into a tit for tat Berlusconi, Italy, Brazil Israel kind of phenomenon where Future leaders are then attacked And challenged and taken to court The best tweet I saw on this Was this woman tweeted out That the following, she said When the Democrats lost in 2016, they Knitted pink hats and donated to plant Parenthood No they didn't, no they didn't They invented a ridiculous Russian conspiracy Theory That like 10 people went to jail The Russia hoax, no one went to jail The Russians were obviously Trying to interfere You're like the last person who still believes in this Well listen, I still believe that they tried And I still believe, I don't know that they succeeded But I think they tried Mueller spent two years investigating this $10 million, $25 FBI Those are all GOP talking points The fact is, Manifurt went to jail For something completely unrelated You must be the last person Who still believes that Trump won In 2016 because of Russian interference I think that they, I think he Asked the Ukraine for help And I think he asked the Russians for help And I think that he would have gladly accepted the help Now, was it a A conspiracy like in the rank No, it wasn't a conspiracy You could never know if it affected it But this is the problem with your Russia talking point is that You're trying to just say because He didn't get prosecuted, which he's probably not Going to get prosecuted for this either The guy is a serial offender Okay, and they were trying to get information From WikiLeaks and they were trying to get The hacks and so I don't know why you can so Clearly see what he's doing David When he incites this violence And then you don't see that he would He has no moral backbone or character And that he wouldn't accept foreign aid No, no, no, it's not that He's a treasonous bastard Here's my view, okay Here's my view is that When you lose an election as a candidate You have to look in the mirror and ask What you did wrong, okay Trump failed to do that two months ago Instead of just taking the L and You know, and he could have blamed it on Late, I mean, there were Instead of just accepting the loss He invented this conspiracy theory that the election Was stolen and he's basically like Freeberg said, been pumping it month after month And his enablers You know, have perpetuated it until We had this total breakdown And storming of the Capitol But again, you know, where was The democratic reassessment Of why they lost in 2016 Who on the democrat side Looked in the mirror and said You know, we shouldn't have lost that election You know, what did we do wrong They didn't do that, instead they blamed it All on Russian interference or Facebook You know, all of a sudden Facebook went From being a darling to being a scapegoat And there was Russian ads being put with Rubles and tons of Link forms confirmed done By the Russians In order to Ferment anti Hillary Sentiment, I mean this actually happened To your point In fact, the election, nobody can know that But it did occur Yes we can, because Yeah, it did, it did, some Okay, so now you're admitting there was Russian interference So you were before saying there wasn't And now you're saying there was I'm talking about why somebody, no No, it's not, because here's Where you're being misleading Is it true that there was some FSB operative somewhere buying ads On Facebook? Yes Hundreds of them, hundreds of them Perhaps thousands Out of billions of impressions It was a microscopic Number of total impressions Of the election and the people who actually looked At those ads thought they were absurd Imagine some operative, hold on Let me finish my point, imagine some operative In Moscow trying to influence the American election By buying ads on Facebook Did they try? Yes Look, foreign intelligence services Are trying all the time But was that the reason They did try, yes And did Trump and his family ask them No, there was no proof of collusion There was no proof of collusion They didn't take the meeting No, that's what Mueller, he spent two years Investigating it and found no collusion Look, so my point is, again We're getting off on a rabbit hole here But my point was, when You as a candidate lose an election You have to take responsibility for that That was not done in 2016 It was not done certainly in 2020 by Trump It is the problem with both our Political parties that they would rather Invent conspiracy theories and lies Than acknowledge why people are rejecting them Yeah, I agree with this, I would say this But that is not the point David, you are right, okay Somewhere along the way We got stuck worrying about The pronouns that we use And which bathrooms should be Or should not be transgendered While the American middle class Was completely gutted from pillar to post That is what's created The boundary conditions for this Every single time there's been an insurrection Or an uprising Or a revolution in America It has never been about ideology It has always been about economics Always And economics is the tip of the spear In this country, whether we like it or not It started with the Boston Tea Party It continued through the Civil War It has always been About that topic So, we all Let it happen, we all have a Responsibility to fix it That though is a topic, I think, for another day Because that's the grand dark of what we need To do in our generation and fix this inequality gap Meanwhile, we do Have this tactical issue Which is you had the leader Of the free world, in my opinion And I think in a lot of reasonable Minded people's opinion Instigating Essentially at a minimum A riot, and at the maximum Some form of like Treason Idiotic form of I mean, the problem is It's just like It's incomprehensible what it is I've fallen on the side that we need To prosecute him now I was 50, 50 on this, but I'll tell you Whatever is If we don't prosecute him There's this sort of unfairness to it I think that's a very good point you made, Tramoth But I also think that He is going, we need to wake people up From this fog they've been in To Friedberg, and I don't, I think We have to free the Republican Party To get back to some More version that is reasonable Like you are, Sax, I would rather see you The Republican Party has Is already rejecting Trump So just look at what's happened In the last 24 to 48 hours Even after this storming of the Capitol Okay, you had Republicans Who were just hours before Objecting to the electors, they basically Were saying, no, I've changed my mind Who was that? Lindsey Graham, but not Ted Cruz Not that other Kelly Loeffler Kelly Loeffler did it, and there were a few other ones Who switched sides, you had Excellent speeches by Lindsey Graham And Romney, I agree with that They spoke very, very eloquently And just today, Elaine Chao Resigned as Secretary of Transportation I think that's mostly significant Who's left, David? In the Republican Party She's Mitch McConnell's wife Look, I think after Georgia The Republican Party was Already blamed Trump for that And now after the storming of the Capitol They're ready to be done with him This idea that you need to prosecute Trump To somehow end His relation with the Republican Party I think it will just backfire What the point is, I think the point is That nobody is above the law And when you lead You know, what, look The thing with the people that attended this rally Is in any other situation And Jason, you said it earlier These are our veterans These are the people that are like working good jobs They're trying to just keep America going They've always believed in American exceptionalism There was nothing wrong with that It was just perverted by this fucking scumbag Yep A complete piece of shit fucking scumbag He's garbage, and I think that's why You have to prosecute him I think you have to make an example of him I know that they, with Nixon They took a different approach, but I just think He's too dangerous to leave unprosecuted Because every time he has some bad behavior Whether it was the Ukraine Whether it's, you know Russia and we can debate what level they wanted to Engage with the Russians Or, you know, in the case of this Riotous behavior You know, I think he's not going to stop That's the thing that I fear is I don't think he's going to stop I would rather take every single person arrested And give them zero days in jail And add it all up and give it to Trump Well, I wouldn't I mean, I agree with you to some degree That they were victims of this Two month propaganda campaign To convince the right That this election was stolen I think a lot of those people who were Storming the Capitol They were there not to steal an election But because they were, thought they were there To prevent the stealing of an election And so, yes, they have been duped By a lot of people Including, you know, leading with Trump But including a lot of other people Who should have known better But that being said, they did make the decision To hop the barricade, smash the windows Go into the Capitol There is some personal responsibility That has to occur But let's talk about this woman for a second And I think it's important to look at This specific case.

This is a person who's a veteran And she Was inside The halls already and was trying to breach another area And she was just shot dead By Secret Service They might have been protecting the VP They might have been protecting Nancy Pelosi Or Mitch McConnell, who knows But they shot her dead Yeah, I saw it on video I mean, it's on video And it's beautiful Coming from a law enforcement family I can tell you that's a clean shooting If she was breaching and they told her Do not come in here, we're going to shoot you And they were protecting, the Secret Service Is protecting an asset They're allowed to shoot you You can't jump that And she's a military vet She's from the Air Force I mean, what is in her mind How wound up was she by Trump And by this propaganda You just said the keyword You cannot be spun up in all of this By Giuliani He's a fucking moron He can barely not wet his pants You're not going to get spun up by Sidney Powell The only person that can really catalyze this Is the person that has the respect That comes with sitting in the seat That's called the presidency of the United States And she's that He's the only one We all know this We all know this We all know this We all know this Look, yeah What do you think about this woman, David? Think about the psychology of this person For a second, the humanity of it I'll say something Man, politics isn't The problem It's kind of the manifestation of the problem If you think about how crazy it is I posted a tweet About this the other day I think it's so crazy That you can show people a TV ad Or a Facebook ad And get them to change their mind on what to vote People are Kind of shown stuff And the bigger problem is this kind of reductionism That's Kind of enveloped all of this If you go back 100 years I guarantee you people were having deeper More civil conversations About differences of opinion and ways to govern And I think It's so easy To put a 30 second reductionist ad In front of someone Insight their amygdala To respond And change their mind about something Or push them in some direction I think that's the bigger issue With what's been going on People are being pushed all the way to one side Or pushed all the way to the other side Through this very simple process There is no dialogue to decide What candidate to vote for Dialogue to decide What path to take Lock his ass up Everything has become extremely binary And the grayscale Is really the reality And unfortunately we've kind of really hurt ourselves In this tribalism over objectivism Approach to how we talk As a society and how we debate And as a result People are pushed over the edge And I think this is a manifestation of that Broader problem Which I think is probably linked to the internet And short attention spans and all this stuff that's going on Well this is also why I think the GOP Has just been completely You know But it's not just the GOP that dominates What I'm saying, I think there's a good segue Into Georgia But you could say the same about AOC And you could say that AOC is doing the same to the Democratic Party And they're equally frustrated With this extremist point of view That they're just Warren or Bernie Sanders And they're capturing the attention None of them got the nomination though And they were close And it was like hey look Give everyone a million dollars Okay great, like and tax the rich 90% Great, like it's easy to say And my point is By the way I think the root of a lot of this Is people are programmed to be unhappy That's how you instigate people to take action The bottom 10% of Americans Make more money and have a better position In the top 10% of Kenyans And it's An incredible statistic if you think about it Go to dollarstreet.org

Or dollarstreet.com and you can actually play around And see what different people live like Around the world, yet in the US We are told at every strata Whether you're wealthy or not wealthy Relative to others in the United States That you should be better off And it is, you know, happiness is the difference Between expectation and outcome And everyone's been set in expectation And as a result, through programmatic work That is done on people in the United States We are being told You should be unhappy Oh and by the way, here's the short term solution To resolve it And it's driving an incredible amount Of behavioral shift And it really threatens democracy As we saw this week And you guys will remember My big loser for the political loser for 2020 Was the American Democratic Constitution And I think we saw that this week And I agree with that On the heels of that Can I ask you guys what you think of this? Basically, Pelosi has told Pence You have to invoke the 25th Amendment Or they're going to take up impeachment What do you guys think about that? I think it's the right thing to do How do you do that? I think there has to be a backstop against that Is it possible Trump could do something crazy? You could, oh here's the thing And I tweeted a free barhar about this If you are impeached successfully You can't run again So I think that this is A way to put the nail in the coffin Of Trump even having the ability To run in 2024 Which I think is why the Democrats are on the right side Of history on this one Maybe they signed a non prosecution agreement With him if he resigns And that's kind of the final That's what I would like to see Jason, why can't you trust voters To make the right decision in 2024? I Do I trust voters? It's not about trusting the voters It's more about Do I think there should be ramifications For somebody's behavior? That's my fear Is that if he keeps getting away with stuff He could do something even more violent or dangerous As Chomad said earlier It's a miracle that 100 people were in shot dead And this wasn't a firefight I mean if somebody takes out a gun At any moment during that and people start shooting We could have hundreds of people, Americans dead Not just the four who died And I think Trump is absolutely capable Of doing something in the last 14 days If he did this 15 days out Why wouldn't he do something else? 7 days out or 3 days out He's a maniac I mean this is insane deranged criminal Lunatic behavior It's completely possible That he could do something more dangerous in the last 14 days I know that that sounds crazy But look at what we saw yesterday I think There is a white knuckle element To the next two weeks We're all kind of white knuckling it To see what's going to happen We have 300 hours to go Till Biden is sworn in I'm counting down the hours It's too insane Everybody's feeling that That being said I just think that I'm more on Freeberg's Point of view on this We have this insane level Of partisan warfare In the US It's gone to a whole other level And Trump has definitely made it worse In the storming of the capital Is the zenith of it It's the apex But the other side's been doing it too And the question is just how we deescalate This insane partisan warfare Isn't Biden the deescalation, Chamath? Isn't Biden being elected? I think it is We picked the most boring candidate Who has the most milk toast, middle of the road approach Who Lindsey Graham likes And who traveled the world with I mean, Lady G loves him To the extent that Biden has a mandate This is it, I mean, and he talked about it In his victory speech that night Which was quite good It's about bringing people together Now look, I mean The issue, one of the issues is You can't ignore the fact that Democrats For the last four years have waged This insane partisan war against Trump I mean, let's not even go into the merits But you had this Two year Mueller witch hunt You then had this impeachment You know, crusade, which Look, if there was a lot of validity to the Impeachment, why wasn't it used as a Campaign issue last year? I just think everybody knows Let me ask you a question Everybody knows that was hyperpartisan And my point is that Yeah, look, I mean, I think it's a good thing If Biden can deescalate things That is, I think, why he Won the election is that he was seen as more of a Sane alternative.

Let me ask you a question, Sax Do you think it would have been Do you think if Trump had been Impeached for the Ukraine Interference and Pence had taken over We would not have seen what we were seeing Yesterday and the country would have been Further along to healing So, you know, no I mean, Pence would not have invited Or asked all of his supporters To come to the Capitol to oppose The counting of the Counting of the electors. Look, that was A unique Trump thing For, you know, he could not accept The loss and had to keep pushing and pushing And pushing on this idea That the election was stolen So it would have been a good idea to impeach Trump No, it wouldn't, because if you had Impeached Trump, well, first of all He was impeached, okay, but if you had voted To convict him, if you had removed him from Office, the Senate had voted to convict Over a phone call, okay And look, I'm not defending the phone call I'm not saying the phone call was perfect Okay, I know Trump says it was perfect It was not a perfect phone call, but you Can't remove a sitting president For that, okay, look, it was unseemly Or whatever, I think we all know what he Was trying to do in that phone call But you can't remove a sitting president Over that, that was hyper partisan And so, no, the country would be much further Apart today if you had done that And so the question now is, well, how do you Bring it back together? And I think I understand where Tramoth is coming from I think that Trump deserves Morally, culpably I think he is culpable Some repudiation Some repudiation, but I don't believe In locking him up or Prosecuting him, that's only going to make Things much more force For this crime We don't even know what else is out there I mean, I have any other issues out there Let's talk about Georgia, I think we've nailed Trump, I mean, unless anybody really feels Like continuing to talk about the situation Stacey Abrams is a genius I mean, my gosh, she should be in charge of everything Yeah, can we get her on the vaccine roll out? Well, Trump It's incredible.

Stacey Abrams did an incredible job On the Democrats side, verbalizing turnout But the reason why The Republicans lost Georgia Is frankly, Trump I mean, Trump cost them Georgia Two months ago, Perdue beat Us off in that Election. He won. He won. He won. He won. That's right. And he's beaten Him before. I think he is I mean, he's not the most wonderful candidate But I think he is a better candidate And he lost because Of these antics over the last Two months, culminating in that insane Phone call that Trump had with The Georgia sector. Oh my god, we haven't even talked about that Rafflesburger, right.

I mean Should he be prosecuted for that? Sacks? Can't you just find the 11,000 Votes? Look, I just think, you know Which one is more prosecutable? Sending People to the Capitol or asking Them and begging them to find him 11,000 Votes. Which one is more prosecutable To you, Sacks, since you're going to be framing stuff Wait, Jason, hold on. Let's move Let's move away from the whole Trump goes to jail for a second. I just want to I think it's important to talk about Georgia because I think David, you're going to make a point. Yeah, exactly.

I mean, look, I think we're going to Hung up too much on the legalities and let's just talk about What's right and wrong, you know, which is What we can agree on and let, you know, lawyers And prosecutors figure out the legalities Um, Ramesh Panuru From National View had a great quote About Georgia. He said that Purdue and Laughler could have survived Any two of these three Being unimpressive candidates Georgia's shifting purple and Trump Being a maniac. And unfortunately You had three out of three and that's why they lost If, uh, it was a great Is a great quote, uh, you know You had the Rafflesberger call You know, can't you just find me the 11,000 Votes the day before the election Or two days for the election.

I mean That had to push swing voters and undecideds To the Democrats And the other thing is that Purdue and Laughler Weren't able to make the best argument that they had Which is if you vote for us You end up with split You prevent the Democrats from having all the power In Washington. So unless You want to give all the power In Washington to a single party You need to vote for us. That was the best Argument for voting for them because there's a lot of people in this country Who believe in splitting their ticket Because they don't trust either party Which is kind of where I'm at But they were unable to make That argument effectively because Trump was still Hanging onto the idea that he was going to be president No, I think David, I honestly I think this comes down to the intelligence of the candidates Kelly Loftor is a moron She's an idiot David Purdue is a good old boy.

He's an idiot They're just stupid. This actually speaks to a bigger problem Which is the Republicans Could do so much better Because they could actually find Younger, more vibrant, intelligent people And instead they find these fucking morons I don't know where they find them But you know, they pulled Kelly Loftor out of some Backstage Dallas beauty pageant And just kind of like fluffed her up And tried to get her to run. She's a moron Loftor was a mistake Complete fucking idiot Did you read the story about her with the WNBA? But I mean Georgia is full of Georgia is full of so many Incredible politicians and they found that idiot That was a huge mistake If they just voted The governor made a huge mistake They appointed her to the last two months So I agree that she's a particularly weak candidate But the Republicans only needed one of these two Elections And Purdue had beaten Ossoff before I agree with you, he's not necessarily the greatest candidate of all time But he has proved better than Ossoff in the past Including November And the reason why he lost Two months later is because what's transpired in the last two months Biden has acted presidential And Trump has done what he's done And that made all the difference And that by the way is why you're seeing The Republicans breaking from Trump They were already on their way to breaking With them and then you had this Story of the Capitol What are the implications for Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz? I think this was a blow to them Because I think that What they were doing in terms of Opposing the The electors Everybody knew it was sort of Cynical and Theater It was theater, it was performative theater Designed to curry favor with Trump So that he might endorse them in 2024 For the nomination It was opportunistic And the problem is it backfired horribly And you know people now see it For what it was and so yeah I think it's going to hurt Ultimately They tried to do something opportunistic And they thought it would help them politically And I think it's going to hurt them But wait I have to ask you guys do you guys know the backstory Of lawfler And the Atlantic Dream the WNBA team? It's tears honestly Jason I'm going to get so angry Because she is just a complete piece of shit Please don't You can bring it up I think she's just a complete I just don't think Saxon Freeburger are aware of this But I think she's a complete piece of shit She basically Basically she was Anti BLM And she was writing letters To the NBA WNBA To not allow the players To be vocal about Black Lives Matter With the you know after the Killing of the murder of George Floyd And so what the team did If you look at that story is They backed Warnock They got on the call with him They refused to say her name And they rallied the support of Warnock Who ultimately beat her And they refused to say her name ever again The players on her own team Courage If you want to see Courage The women that play in the WNBA Are some of the most incredible people In the world These are women that have Basically stopped their athletic career Stopped fame Stopped all of the attention In some cases stopped fortunes To work on behalf of criminal justice reform To basically overturn Unjust convictions These women are incredible And then to be suppressed To be able to say what was on their mind Kelly Loeffler is a piece of shit And they basically wore these Vote Warnock T shirts Every day at every game I mean imagine And now they're I think going to be forced Bravo to those women I give them Sue Bird I think is the Was the leader of the whole movement Bravo to her I think we have to talk Freedberg about the deployment Of the vaccine I did a quick poll on Twitter And Twitter and the American people Have asked that Freedberg the queen of Canoie be responsible for the Vaccine distribution Going forward Really? I'm in let's do it I would get that Vaccine into everyone's arms In 75 days You would be Such a stone cold lock That would be amazing Freedberg what would you do I would love to do that We were supposed to be at a million a day We're at 350 trending towards 400 we did 1.5

million In 72 hours according to Fauci At one point right after the new year So we're kind of like halfway Where we need to be What would you do differently Because the rollout seems More than 50% are on the shelves It is a war time Scenario when war is happening You don't go home at 5pm And wake up at 9am And clock out for an hour For lunch and you know You don't run too fast You might trip you don't do any of that We've created incredible disincentives In the system In fact Cuomo put out A million dollar fine If you get your vaccine Out of line I mean think about This incentive that creates Now people are more scared About giving the vaccine to the wrong person Than they are incentivized To give the vaccine to the right person And the reality is this is a Group game this isn't an individual game It's not about who gets vaccinated first And you'll live and you'll die We all need to get vaccinated As a group so that we all Have immunity so that this virus stops spreading It doesn't matter if you're Individually vaccinated it matters Because that's the only way we're all going to get out of the Economic slump that is truly damaging This country right now and so the first Step is create a military Style operation figure out How many feet on the ground you know it's all A rate based system right how many Are you running per day and then how do you Achieve that objective and over time You have your target rate per day You would scale it up over 75 days Whatever your roll out time frame needs to be And you would say this is how we're going to get there We need this number of people giving shots To the part and then you go figure out Where are you going to give the shots and who's going to give them Get the vaccines to where they need to get to Take over all the gymnasiums and all the Stadiums and all the open sports facilities Around the country people can drive up Stand in line get a friggin Shot and 65 year olds Get priority for the first 30 days and then After 30 days you're 65 and over Crowd loses their priority and It's open season for who wants to get a shot You stand in line you get a shot walk in You got 3.8

million Nurses in the United States You go contract 500,000 of them You give them a huge friggin one time bonus To come and run this program you run 24 hour shifts In the gymnasiums around the country People come in they get shots they get out Takes 3 minutes if you're feeling weird If you have risk of allergies you go sit in The other room you wait for 2 hours and there's a bunch of roaming nurses Keeping an eye on you and you get this thing done That's it this is not that complicated And we can leverage the national Guard to create the infrastructure to support these lines And get these things done we can go recruit There are plenty of nurses association You can go people can work overnight shifts And get paid triple overtime get extra bonuses For doing this is a great way to kind of Create an economic stimulus around this We can get at this entire country vaccinated 90 days and the way that Israel is doing it is a great model You know when they run out of So at the end of the day if You know when you open when you take these things out Of deep freeze you're at risk of them spoiling At that point because the mRNA is very You know it can break and so it needs to be really Cold and then you got to give the vaccine very quickly Otherwise the mRNA can degrade and it's not effective And you have to defrost it in order to give it Yes you defrost it then it's sitting there Now you got to give it within a couple hours And if you got extra doses sitting at the end of the day What they're doing in Israel is they're looking outside They grab the pizza guy that's on the bicycle On the bicycle cruising by they're like do you want a shot Come on in they give them a shot they grab the next guy You do not need to track everyone that gets a shot You do not need everyone to show their ID To get a shot you do not need to X Y and Z All the disincentives that create Friction in the system of rolling out the vaccine Need to be completely eliminated There's no qualifying criteria except Maybe being 65 and over for the first 30 days And we've prioritized politics Over health and safety We have made it the case that the teachers Should get the shot first because the teachers Union's created an uproar in California and said They're not going to go to work unless they So now the teachers are going to get it and the Essential workers are going to get it which are people That are working in stores and warehouses and other stuff And meanwhile the people that can actually die from this 15% likelihood of death if you're over 85 Are not getting it Because they're not technically an essential worker So the prioritization where we've tried to create These artificial politically motivated systems For defining who gets the vaccine and who doesn't Is absolutely killing us and literally Killing us 4,000 people died yesterday In the United States and so The system is fucked up The incentives we've and don't bleep that out Because that's exactly what it is The disincentives we've created Are destroying the rollout The governors getting involved And creating models of prioritization That are politically motivated are killing us And we should centrally plan this thing War production act, make a shit ton of the stuff Grab it all, get 100 million doses distributed Into gymnasiums around the country Get the nurses in there, get the National Guard They should have been federal, I mean that's the key 24th effort Central planning is sometimes needed to get shit done We did it with the war production board during World War II We did it with the Manhattan Project There have been countless examples Where we've had to centralize planning For a massive short term event And this is one of those events And this needs to be Prioritized and organized centrally And it needs to have the right minded people on this Not kind of people that are You know, political operatives and not people that are working 9 to 5 This is a war and we need to go win the fucking war Trump has time He's at Camp David this weekend so I think he can put some Attention to it Can I ask a question, Freeberg? So, you know What do you think about just using markets To distribute the vaccine? It's a great idea, I think you have to get the incentive Such that time based systems are the incentive Right, because the objective here is to get as many people Vaccinated as quickly as possible So take that being your objective And then figure out, look, you guys are going to get A thousand dollars per person vaccinated In the first 15 days and then you're going to get 500 dollars and then whatever the Transition is and then anyone can Sign up to buy doses at a cost So they have skin in the game That's an alternative, so let Walgreens and CVS Buy 50 million doses And then their incentivize to get them rolled out as quickly As possible, let them do the work, sure And frankly, if a few people have Anaphylactic reactions across the country That's just the reality, in war You have some casualties, this can't be perfect It has to be good enough to win the war Well, by the way When somebody goes into anaphylactic shock Just to clarify that Yeah, you get an epi shot, it's not fatal If you have an epi pen That's right, and so When you get a You know, a vaccine If you get one of these vaccines 40% to 60% of people Are going to have some sort of reaction You're going to have a fever, because these produce A ton of proteins in your body Relative to what you would normally experience With a dead vaccine There's a lot of protein in your body Your body reacts to get rid of that protein Very quickly, so you end up having a fever You end up having some allergic response Or headaches, or flushing, or whatever So everyone's going to have A lot of people are going to have some sort of thing So one of the concerns is they want to have nurses available And they want to have this feel like a controlled medical environment But again, the reality is We have to sack it up We have to accept the fact that people are going to be uncomfortable It is not going to be an easy, simple Vaccine, like you get the flu vaccine at Walgreens It's going to be a little bit uncomfortable You may not have five or six nurses surrounding you And getting all the TLC that Americans have become Used to getting every time we brush our freaking teeth And we're going to have some people Going to anaphylactic shock And they're going to get EpiPen shots And we shouldn't be charging $1,500 for EpiPen shots That's another important point But I think the market based model could work as well Has Israel done this right? I mean, Israel They moved the old people to the front of the line But anybody can get in line If they've got extra doses that day They just keep sticking people And they keep jabbing people until they run out Until they run out They're probably at 20% of the population by now I'm sure we all agree with everything you're saying It speaks to an enormous amount Of political incompetence I mean, it's really, really just unbelievable Why we just don't have Smarter people in charge of these things But Sacks, I just want to ask you Because there is the conservative argument on this Which is The federal government shouldn't be doing everything And states need to kind of manage their populace And manage what goes on locally What is the conservative I'm not asking you this and I'm not attacking you I'm just asking like What is the conservative argument for not doing Central planning and Central organization Around vaccine distribution And delegating it to states Do you think that there's a case against For that that's pretty strong Within the Republican party That's conservative I think if there's a conservative point of view On this, it would just be that let markets Distribute the vaccine, they'll do a much better job I think whether it's federal Or state, the question is Who's more incompetent than I'm not really sure I think the problem right now Is that when you make vaccine distribution Fundamentally political Then the debate becomes about Exactly who's What is your position going to be exactly in line As opposed to just running the most number of people Through the process as quickly as possible We're getting ourselves so twisted up in knots Over making sure that the exact right person Is in line That we're having vaccine go to waste And just to put that in context 21 million Plus doses have been distributed in the United States 5.9

have made their way into people's arms In other words There are 15 millions Over 75% of doses have not gone in people's arms And in California We have distributed 5.85% Of the populations Vaccines, but we've only put 1.3 in people's arms So we are literally 4x Where we should be We're at 25% of where we should be It is absolutely unbelievable that this is happening If the government Stop trying to do anything Except, look it did operation warp speed That actually did help get vaccines done faster But if you just That was just money to your point, Saks All they did was create a market Where they basically pre bought all the vaccines Whether or not they were going to work And then funded the market to go and produce them early That's all that it was So to your point, that operation warp speed For everyone thinking it's a massive centrally controlled effort It was a market based incentive It wasn't the Manhattan Project is what you're saying It was a check They put up a couple billion dollars And said to all these pharma companies Go produce the vaccine And if it works, we'll buy them But let's get production going And that was it Can I use this as a segue? What we're seeing is We have a bunch of elected officials We give them An enormous amount of responsibility They also get this implied power And then You see sometimes in these acute moments They're totally derelict Then I just want to move off of vaccines for a second Then you get an elected official Who is not acutely incompetent But it seems broadly Grossly and consistently incompetent And I want to talk about Chesa Boudin And I want to use Saks's article Which to be very honest, David Was probably one of the most incredibly Well written things You have ever created I don't know Jason, do we have show notes? Can we put it in We'll put it in the show notes, yeah We'll put a link in the show notes It is so fucking good what you wrote If everybody folks who are listening have a chance to read David's Killer DA The Killer DA But it basically starts with the profile Of this young woman Seemed like an incredible woman that was killed By this drunk driver But anyways, David, do you want to talk about it? Yeah, I mean, so for the last I'd say for the last couple of months I've been on Twitter A couple of San Francisco Police Department accounts On Twitter and I was noticing these Extraordinary tweets which are getting retweeted a lot About how they kept Arresting And then having to let go of all these criminals Who are committing burglaries and other crimes And you could see the frustration Of the police department Boiling off these tweets And basically they are Subtweeting this new district attorney That we've had, Chesa Boudin He's been in office about a year, he's elected at the end of 2019 And so I started doing a little bit of research And then we had this horrible New Year's Eve Killing of this You know, wonderful young woman Hannah Abe Who came to America from Japan For college and stayed here for work She was just 27 years old She gets killed by A criminal Someone who was released, who was paroled By Chesa Boudin Back in April, he had been in jail For armed robbery Chesa released him As part of a plea bargain And then he was arrested five more times For stealing cars and other crimes Most recently, two weeks ago And the DA refused To press charges and that's the reason he was out On New Year's Eve He stole a car and then There was this hit and run where he killed Hannah And another woman And so, you know, I had already been noticing This issue and so I started doing some Research And I have a research assistant helping me with this It's the only way I could put something like this together And we went pretty deep and we realized That the death of Hannah Wasn't Just an accident or an act of negligence By this DA, it was part of An overall philosophy Of decarceration that he has But he, his Background is very interesting He was a child of parents who were in The weather underground Who, when he was just a baby, committed armed robbery And were part of the murder David, say the words They were domestic terrorists That's right, they were domestic terrorists They participated in an armed robbery against a Brinks truck which resulted in it And these were domestic terrorists that were competent When compared to what we saw yesterday in the Capitol Like these are highly Capable domestic terrorists To be clear about the murder I don't know how capable they were But they were in prison They were in prison His mother spent 20 years in prison His father is still in prison For almost 40 years And he's described In interviews how his earliest memories Are visiting his parents in prison And how this shaped his entire Political outlook And he became a public defender Which I think was a pretty good place for him I think if I Were an indigent criminal defendant I would want someone like Jason Boudin on my side But the problem is He ran for district attorney And he simply doesn't believe In prosecuting huge numbers of crimes Certainly Property crimes, burglary Shoplifting, vandalism And those crimes have Absolutely spiked in the city You know, a 45% increase in Burglaries in one year, 35% Increase in stolen cars 30% increase in homicides Crimes are through the roof because He simply doesn't believe in putting people In jail Can I just say this? Sorry, let me just point out There's a little bit of a history to To this notion that DA's should change the criminal justice system There's a TED talk By a guy named Adam Faw I don't know if you've seen it Or if any of you guys have watched it I was at the TED conference the year that he spoke But this guy He basically thought, he made the case That it is the role and the opportunity For the district attorney, for the prosecutor To change the criminal justice system From the prosecutorial side That you can kind of Demotivate jail and other Kind of mechanisms Of punishment And push for a Rehabilitation program as an alternative And that the district attorneys can take this Roll on of changing the criminal justice system And it created a little bit of a mini movement There was a lot of attention and follow up After he gave his TED talk And I think San Francisco in large part Picked up on the momentum coming out of This and other similar sort of stories About the DA can really change the criminal justice system And Chesa Boudin really kind of Capitalized on it In principle, a lot of people are motivated From a good place when they elected him Which is, it is unfortunate a lot of people Get trapped in a life of crime And the fact that they're in and out of prison Is a result of the fact that they're put into A place and parole is really harsh on people And all these other reasons why People's lives are ruined for simple mistakes And if they get an opportunity in life They can fix themselves and they can come out In a better place So there is a bit of an origin story It's not just like San Francisco said let's get an anarchist To be our DA and destroy the world And kill us all I think it came from a good and true place Where this all kind of originated But obviously the experiment has gone severely awry In San Francisco and his particular methods And his particular actions have certainly Caused far more harm than anyone has seen any good As that's how we pointed out Dave started a recall effort for him too Well I think the danger is Not that you have An enlightened political philosophy I think that's actually quite great Than that we can experiment I think the danger is both on the left And on the right where people Cathartically deal with childhood trauma Through their job And you know I don't know what Chesa Boudin Has gone through and I feel very bad That he had an incredibly hard life Or complicated Or maybe not I don't even know But I wouldn't want to know That he's trying to deal With his own experiences Through his job Because that's not his job Meaning you know you don't want an activist DA I think you want a DA That's enforcing the laws and what you do want Is you want to elect politicians who change the laws To reflect our values Yeah that would be a better Throughline I think And really if you look at what's happening In San Francisco I think we've conflated Income inequality Which people in San Francisco are very tuned into With essentially Junkies people who are addicted To incredibly hardcore drugs That are very hard to Get off of and we've had more Debt from overdoses of fentanyl Than we've had from COVID By a magnitude of four or five I mean it is bedlam on the streets Of San Francisco And if you don't enforce A basic rule of law What happens is the price of drugs gets cheaper More available More people try them, more people get addicted And then more people come from other places Because they know you have the lowest price On drugs and the price of drugs Is inversely correlated with Prosecution of drug crimes So on prosecution of crimes This is why San Francisco is spiral And most drugs are purchased from criminal funds So criminal activity goes up To fund the drug purchasing So that's the vicious cycle That's driving San Francisco And there's a recall going on And then in related news Gavin Newsom is now up to A million signatures in his recall Which I think is two thirds of the way there Yeah They have until mid or late February They're going to get the votes And I think The question, you know, Friedberg and I talked about this Just on a phone call, he and I caught up a couple days ago I think it is time guys For us to find An incredibly centrist Thoughtful candidate And put them into the recall race Against Newsom Friedberg had the best idea which was Kim Kardashian Which I think is incredible because she is very smart She's very likeable She's got enormous distribution She's like, she's about to become a lawyer You know, that will be the best platform for Kardashian To run for president Look, it's pretty clear You know, recognition, influence, fame Is what gets people elected You know, not the best policy and not the greatest experience From Jesse Ventura to Arnold Schwarzenegger To Donald Trump Ronald Reagan I mean, these are celebrities Who I would argue in the case of Jesse Ventura Arnold Schwarzenegger and maybe even Donald Trump as well Their celebrity was kind of You know, it had hit its Media driven apex And this was a second act And perhaps someone like that Is a great fit here Kim Kardashian really fits the bill But, you know That's just a shot in the dark But I do think someone like that needs to go up Because if you put politician up again It's another one of these eye rolling events And for the populace to kind of really find Appeal, it has to be a recognized person You know, broadly recognized and liked person I want to end It could be you GovernorJason.com

I'm not ready to run for political office I'm 50, and when I'm 60 I would consider it actually But not right now I want to work I think we all got a hop, but I was going to say one thing Which is the beginning of today's podcast Was probably the punchiest it's ever been And I think it just speaks to the fact that there was so The bar was so high For Trump to have done something That would have actually gotten us to actually argue And interrupt each other Because we've been so incredibly loving And protective of each other For four years on this topic But it literally took an armed insurrection For us to finally Just say enough stuff The besties Well, I mean, I think It's good for people to see Sacks, maybe an eye Or Chamath Or whoever Disagree on some of these cases Or Friedberg, you know, doesn't believe in prosecuting Trump I think we actually had a split ticket there Where Sacks and Friedberg felt like We shouldn't prosecute Trump and Chamath and I were in the prosecute Trump one But I think we're all struggling with these issues All Americans are struggling with these issues Of how do you deal with a black swan event I think that's what's so unique about Trump Is, and I think David You can speak to this is I don't think the system Was designed For his level of crazy Right, like our system is based on norms And traditions And trust, just like venture investing is And we see this in venture investing Some founder goes off the, jumps the fence And all of a sudden, you know I would say our system Perform pretty well In terms of being stress tested And, well look, we still got two more weeks I think we're all kind of white Knuckling it right now Hoping nothing else happens But look, if Trump's goal Was a coup, you know I think it's a strong word But if it, like, it totally failed I mean, he didn't come close to No, to succeeding in a coup The opposite, in fact The opposite, he, again We talked about how I think his He destroyed his popularity over the last two months He impacted his earnings by Negative two billion dollars Yeah, so But, you know But to this point about us agreeing or disagreeing You know, I saw a whole bunch of Fans of the pod At mentioning me saying, I wonder what Sacks is going to say about this I don't know what, like, yeah And I'm kind of like, what do they think I'm going to say Like they think I'm going to be supportive of this I mean, you know Like, I think somehow Jason, you've programmed the viewers That I'm somehow like The Trump guy You know, because you're always trolling me As the Trump supporter, I mean, I would Well, you believed that Russia was a hoax And that people would have been treated the same Climbing up those steps, we all know that's not true Well, we're relapsing Some of these are self inflicted wounds of your own Gonna take some ownership there Boys, boys, I got a hop I love you very much, happy new year Happy new year, Bashes I will say one thing, before we meet next time I guarantee you some highly unexpected And highly impactful thing will occur Please, no Can we get back to talking about SPACs Or the Bachelor We didn't even talk about My SPAC today Give it a plug, go ahead I mean, just explain to people what you did He doesn't need a plug at Double today, it's insane Alright, we'll explain what happened IPOE is merging with SoFi It's an incredible company led by An incredible CEO, Anthony Nodo You can read a little one Pager on my website, but anyways Guys, more importantly, to all the listeners out there Happy new year to all of you guys Let's make 2021 kick ass I love you guys I miss you Oh, look, there's somebody Interrupted, I gotta go Next time, take us out Young Spielberg, take us out, Young Spielberg You should all just get a room And just have one big huge orgy Because they're all just useless It's like sexual tension, but we just need to release somehow What?
