J. Cal you look a little grifty. You'll okay. Yeah me. I'm great. I'm great. You look half a milli richer today What's it like to be half a milli richer? J. Cal you look like a failed hostage taker Left it up boys left it up boys left it up boys when you see my other projects drop You're gonna be crying again. Okay. I can't wait. Why don't you take yes for an answer J. Cal? I have taken this for an answer Welcome to the all in podcast with three miserable rich masters and pull up the ladder behind him Do you want to explain why it took us a month to produce a new episode J.

Cal? Hold on a second attorney. Let me give you guys the TLDR J. Cal thought the all in pod was his and then he realized it wasn't No, if you guys want to go there we go there. I'm totally transparent I request it. I request it to own six percent more of the all in podcast No, no, no back up to the summit back up to when you wanted to know back up before that where we oh my god Are we really doing this? Yeah, we're gonna do it. Okay. If you want to do it We do it we can't talk about this for 45 minutes because what happened is so boring so plan the so boring We plan the summit J.

Cal doesn't like how I was concerned about the summit and I bitched at him And you know I was negative to him finish the summit and J. Cal wants to kick me off the show Yes, Brad Gerstner Bill Gurley would have higher Here comes the bullying. I'm here. I'm the boy and J. Cal getting into it. It wasn't it was actually it started with free Berg and J. Cal getting into it. I wanted me off the show All right, I'll do I get to explain the series of events or no, okay wanted me off the show True or false J.

Cal I felt That if free Berg if free Berg wasn't enjoying his time here and was going to constantly Complain every week about every detail why the show is not good There was always the option for him to maybe do half the shows and have Brad Gerstner do half the shows or have Bill Gurley or rotate in and so if he was going to be miserable all the time and worried about the show I gave him the option to have somebody else take his spot. Did you or did you not say that? This is your show.

You're the leader and you wanted me off the show. I never said that Nor would I say that I don't need you said you could summarily replace any of us Effectively you acted like we all work for you as your show sacks. I don't think she wants replaceable just for the record So that's true. He does think that you're not sure about replaceable free Berg I do think I mean I could pull up the brad gerson episodes I think they have slightly more views so but people love you so we keep you Cal told my mom and my wife that he thought I was replaceable on the show guys I would like to jump in by just summarizing this so that we can move on so basically what happened was we had an Agreement that it was 25% each.

There was a moment where Jay Cal believed that he deserved more We had to sort through a lot of the underlying issues that caused him to believe that we got to a good Consensus we now have a signed agreement that governs how the show and other things around the show and offshoots of the show Will work we are 25% equal partners and now we can move on so enough for the bitching. Let's go all good And I love you all I love you all too. I love you all too to be clear my position I do feel like this needs about here was if we're gonna make it into a media company My request was listen I think I own I should have 10% more equity and I'll go to work every day and do the work and you guys can just show up You guys agree to that and then you guys said you don't want to do it and I said okay fine So here we are we're back at square one.

So let's just get to work I just want to do a pod and we just want to talk there's not going to be any more summits It's not going to be any business here. It's just a pod. I have other events. I do I have other pods I do if I want to get paid I'll do them over there and here it's just a pod that you see every week So let's get into it. Everybody wants to talk about markets. Oh, by the way, if you guys want your intros That's 1% each Those are 1% each so when you guys are willing to pay me my 1% additional equity you get the intros and when you want the all in Summit 2023 that's another one.

We're gonna get an invoice each week from J. Cal now You're gonna get it's gonna be prorated monthly. It's gonna be a point eight percent equity per month vested I just think it's so fascinating that we went through all of this, you know I don't know Sturman Drong or whatever this this like a month of non taping and You know and this like all this turmoil in our relationship So you could get an extra 1% from us 2% each 31 I believe I should just so you know I do this for a living and if I do extra work, I believe I should And if you want me to be the the de facto CEO of this then I should get a little extra.

Yeah, we don't want that And you don't want that so that's fine That's fine. This is just gonna be a project we do it every week and then all your griffs Whatever, you know, you're spinning out from the production board or whatever Copycat app you're making you can fucking do As an as a side grift here we go do the intro step in doing come on. Let's go. No, there's no zero interest no interest Intros are out. What about hey everybody? Hey everybody? I'll do a hey everybody. Hey everybody on the house. Hey everybody. Hey everybody Welcome to us.

I'm free me for you. He freaks free for you. We open sources to the fans and they've just gone crazy Hey everybody, welcome to another episode of the all in podcast we're back for episode 84 with me of course The Sultan of science the Prince of Panic attacks the Queen of Kinwa himself David Freberg. How you doing buddy? Great to be here great to be here. All right, and Can you feel the tension? There's a lot of tension. There's a little tension there. J.K. L and I'll be hanging out tomorrow night We'll make it. Have you guys resolved it? I'm cool.

I'm cool free break. I mean, I bought him dinner I think we're he did buy me a wonderful dinner. Oh my lord after the Warriors game shout out to the Warriors all right, and of course With us is the rain man himself David sacks. How you doing buddy? Good. You ready to go don't try and deflect this thing on to me I was only tangentially involved Says the guy who spent 72 hours on the contract. I wrote a very fair contract so that we can move forward Yeah, and then you proceeded to break it in the first 15 minutes by slandering me and disparaging me, but oh come on That was good for ratings.

Good for ratings. Yes. I thought your meme was pretty great He did the meme The two buttons of the superhero trying to pick and I was like Jason That was good making jokes Uh breaking the breaking the non disparaging clause and then of course the dictator himself Uh from some undisclosed location in a european city I don't know if i'm allowed to say that jamael the polyhobitia. Welcome back boys episode 84. What's up boys? All right. Uh, well since we last convened uh, let's get it on. Yes the the all in summit is finished all the episodes have been released Uh including pomeral lucky yesterday And here we go the markets are in complete turmoil.

Uh spy down 21 year to date dows down 17 year to date As sax has pointed out that is not representative of what happened to growth stocks at the same time And uh the maycp i uh went up and it was at 8.6. We also got the 75 basis point rate hike Who wants to start here chumath? I mean, uh, it's market so maybe i'll just dump it to you first and then we'll go around the horn to Saxon then freer bird. Well, there's a lot to say so bear with me for a second but um The thing that you have to do before you talk about what is happening now I think it's probably useful to go back And you have to really start at the end of the great financial crisis and the reason is There was a bunch of people coming out of the gfc Who confused what the u.s.

Government and some european governments were doing at the time? There was the risk of a huge financial contagion And so the u.s. Stepped in And the federal reserve started to use their balance sheet to buy toxic assets right And the ecb did that and i think japan did that as well anyways a bunch of banks did it I mean a bunch of governments did it and then there was this body of pseudo scientists Pacific economists who coined this thing called modern monetary theory Which basically said hey you can keep printing money And introducing it into the economy to smooth things out and to actually drive long term growth And it turns out that a bunch of government officials fell for it And if you fast forward to 2022 so 14 years later You know governments around the world had printed something to the tune of about 30 35 odd trillion dollars Of money into the economy that should have never been there So the thing to remember is like we have not necessarily just been obfuscating true supply demand in the last six or eight months when we've been talking about a recession or inflation We've been actually doing it since 2008.

It's just that it's been building up in the system So one of the things that we have to realize is that all of that money somehow needs to get destroyed in some way shape or form If the true economic equilibrium is meant to be found What is true supply? What is true demand in the absence of government sloshing money around? Trying to prop up things that should not be propped up or buying votes or all the grifts that these folks have Engaged in in the last you know decade and a half have to get undone So that's the backdrop.

So if you think about taking 30 trillion dollars out of the global economy You know, you're talking about almost You know, I think it's 85 trillion is the world GDP. So like, you know, it's it's it's almost half of an entire year's worth of global GDP It's going to take three years probably of the slow meticulous You know running off of money, you know not reintroducing new money So it seems like we're at the beginning of the beginning of something that's going to be long and drawn out Now that's separate from and that's separate from whether we're in a recession or not That's just the bare market that we're in Right.

And so you have to look at asset prices today as a microcosm Of a much larger trend That has to be about fake money pushing asset prices up And now taking all that fake money out and finding out what the real price of something is And I just don't think that takes six months. So for all the people that were You know fingers crossed hoping that this would be the end of it fed raises 75 were done with this They're going to raise 75 more I just think that's not how it's probably going to be it's going to take, you know 24 36 months that may mean the bottom doesn't happen for another 18 months So I think it's a we're in for a lot of choppy Market action sex three asset bubbles clearly all You know being impacted we had stocks looks like that story was pretty violent Then we had crypto this last two or three weeks have been absolutely insane in terms of that asset bubble and now record high inventories for homes record Sales are now dipping below the average of the last 20 years and We're seeing a mortgage origination just absolutely get crushed 6% mortgages just a couple of months ago.

It was 2.x For some folks. So when you look at those three asset bubbles, do you buy cheats? Hey, we're going to see even more deprecation these for another 18 months possibly or do you think we've Taken such crazy action. This has come down so violently that we're now bouncing along the bottom bouncing along the bottom or 18 months of more pain Well, the stock market, especially growth stocks may have taken the majority of the carnage But you're right. There are other asset classes and I think we're going to see the carnage start to rotate into those So you're right if you look at residential real estate now The prices are at the highest they've been relative to median income Since something like 2006 2007 before that sort of great real estate crash that precipitated the great recession of 2008 So I think there are going to be more shoes to drop.

I just want to build on Chimás point about root causes here Milton Friedman once said that there's nothing quite so permanent as a temporary government program The temporary government program was quantitative easing. We had this Great recession of 2008 that could have turned into a depression. They broke the glass in case of emergency They started this QE which is basically the government intervening to buy bonds in the market They had never done that before and they loaded up their balance sheet The crazy thing is that program was still continuing until last year. Why? I mean, it was like on cruise control And so last year it was it was it was continuing until last month and countries like Europe are still doing it 9% inflation in Europe and they're still buying bonds, right? So you go back to last year the Fed bought the balance sheet And then last year the Fed bought 54% of the government's debt despite the fact that the economy was growing at like 5% GDP That it was bouncing back really strongly from covid that you had the stock market at all time highs And yet they were still intervening with this massive QE And then when we got the the surprise 5.1%

inflation print last summer They didn't stop QE till the end of Q1 So you're right. They kept basically printing money And it's still going on and that's created massive distortions in the economy now So the Fed I would say is the number one culprit here and J. Powell is the number one culprit But the number two culprit is the biden administration And I think biden did three things very early on in the first few months of his presidency to effectively tank his presidency number one He canceled our energy independence on his first day in office Canceling the keystone pipeline and making it much harder to drill and of course energy inflation is the one factor in this sort of overall inflation number two He pushed through that last two trillion of stimulus on straight party lines the arp The american rescue plan after larry summer said economists in his own party said this is going to create inflation Don't do it And then the third thing is and no one really talks about this is that biden could have used diplomacy In 2021 to basically find an off ramp to this ukraine crisis before it turned into a full fledged war And if you listen to the economists the international development economists like jeffrey sacks He basically says that biden polled his cabinet and said listen should we Negotiate and compromise with the russians.

They all said no and biden handed down the order. We will not compromise with the russians so Now we have this massive war in ukraine that's fueling food and energy inflation It's going to tank his presidency and I don't even think there was any debate but we are now cabinet about this We may not be negotiating against russia, but we're enabling them to print enormous Surpluses meaning I don't know if you guys saw but there was an article today janet yellen is traveling around basically convincing folks to Not include russian oil from a bunch of import bans so that these russian oil tankers can be insured Why so that they can sell this oil to places like china and india etc the rubles out of five times five year high The rubles out of five year high we push for all these sanctions europe gets on board and says we're going to do it And we're going to take the lumps and then we go around europe and basically say well We kind of want to fight this proxy war, but at the same time we want to try to fix inflation and we didn't mean to cause this and It's completely disorganized.

What's happening? Okay, so if you had six minutes in the pool for when sacks would blame biden for the economy you win Who do you blame? We talked about quantitative easing starting in 2008 so that that goes over a couple of presidents and I guess the question I would have for you sacks is how much of the spending the free willing spending, you know, um, you know Was from the previous administration because it doesn't seem like spending is a bipartisan problem There's no question about it. But what I do want to make sure that we point that out Yeah, for sure and republicans only seem to find their principles on spending whether there's a democrat in the white house I totally get it and I would like to see more fiscal responsibility Regardless of which party is in power and I like to see the republicans less be less hypocritical in their principles on this But look here's the thing the economy was bouncing back strongly last year And biden still pushed for this last two trillion spending and then in 1.2

trillion more on infrastructure And then remember the four trillion a build back better We're managing safety themselves exactly. I mean, what would if what would that have looked like? freeberg you haven't spoken yet thoughts on you know this These asset bubbles I guess and then The buying of the bonds seemed completely unnecessary for some period of time if we are acting as the 50 plus buyer of bonds What kind of distortion does that create in the market because if the government's competing against other people in the marketplace to buy those bonds How could they possibly be priced correctly? Let's just be very careful about our framing.

There's the u.s. Treasury which Issues bonds and raises capital On behalf of the u.s. government for spending programs Then there's the central bank the federal reserve and our central bank's job is to number one maintain liquidity In the capital markets so that businesses can invest In growing their their products and growing their businesses and the economy grows while Not providing too much liquidity That you end up with inflationary effects and inflationary effects means that there's too much money in the market And you see that money find its way into escalating prices on different, you know assets And the feds long term goal to remember is to provide A stated goal of Jerome Powell in particular right now this changes over time But generally the intention of the federal reserve is to make liquidity to make cash available To banks who ultimately make it available to businesses In such a way that there's enough cash in the system That the businesses grow and that people have capital to invest in growth While keeping inflation at 2% so their long term target is 2% inflation and it's also Correct me if i'm wrong but making sure that there's enough cash to support economic growth So remember last year you'll remember stan drunkenmiller was very public about how insane it was That the federal reserve was still buying bonds And so so there's one way to introduce cash into the system Is to make cash available as a loan to banks and then those you know banks use that money to loan to businesses And it makes its way through the economy another way is for the federal reserve to step in and actually buy bonds Freeing up the money that other people would be otherwise using to buy bonds to go and invest in other things So they're effectively forcing liquidity into the market by taking bonds out of the market And last summer of last year drunkenmiller was pounding the table saying guys The economic indicators on how quickly the markets are and how quickly the economy is growing Relative to how much inflation there is Indicates that we should stop buying bonds and we should stop injecting liquidity into the markets This makes no sense.

It is nonsensical And there was no strong point of view from the Fed at the time other than there was uncertainty about the bounce back of the From the recession from covid There was uncertainty about what else was happening in the economy and yada yada But the the numbers the economic indicators were showing very clearly the economy is growing in a robust pace Low unemployment and inflation is starting to pick up Holy crap It's time to cool it off and the Fed made a judgment call and their judgment call Really kind of was to keep going And then we end up in this massive runaway inflationary problem Where if you keep too much liquidity in the system for too long you have inflation Even if you have economic growth and now by pulling the money out of the system super super fast We reduce the inflationary effects potentially But We tank the economy because now all this money coming out of the market means people are spending less and buying less And businesses have less to borrow the borrowing costs are high and then that that's that's the big vacuum Hold on.

Let me go to chumath and then sex I just want to say one thing the rate the rate at which we pull the money out which has had to be really really fast over the last few weeks Can cause a recession and that's the biggest concern right now Is will that actually trigger a massive recession or not that everyone's watching? So chumath, I guess one of the things we need to clarify here is the actual mandate of the fed I was under the Understanding that the fed really was there to make sure of maximum employment and that you know low interest loans were available And price stability these are the where the stated goals for a long time low interest rates Capital capital is available availability to grow Without exceeding inflation of 2% that's the goal.

So maximum employment price stability was also in the Growth because remember we can't ever pay our debt if our GDP is not growing While minimizing while keeping inflation below 2% Chumath whatever point you want to make feel free to make but also I was just wanted to know from you Where did the fed go wrong with their mandate if at all here because we do have maximum employment right now But we have added control price stability Look, here's the thing you I think we have to Also be sensitive to the fact that the fed operates on a certain class of data And that data in the 21st century is pretty pathetic Nick you can probably find this but there was an article I think it was in the new york times That really walked through how cpi is calculated and it's a bunch of people that work for the government that walk around with ipads Building relationships with local businesses and all these random places all around the country And asking them to you know chit chat for 15 minutes and do these surveys Now you would have thought that in 2023 or 2022 What the government would have said to you know visa mastercard american express all the payment rails the banks and stripe is Send me a feed in the following structured way so that I can actually have an absolute precise sense of inflation because Inflation really only occurs when a good or a service trades hands for money Right and you calculate.

What did that thing trade at the day before and what is it trade for today? So you could get an absolute precise sense of it instead. We do this Random sampling thing and it's subjective humans etc. So if you read this article your takeaway will be oh my god This is very rickety and it drives an enormous hammer that we use to try to manage the economy That's the first thing I think you need to buckle your seat belt because the next three four five months of cpi Will probably be very very bad 789 percent why there are a handful of components that have gotten completely run away Number one the biggest one is rent and so rent works on a three month lag We're going to reintroduce what the true owners equivalent rent is into cpi So we can already forecast that cpi going up Oil is at 105 bucks a barrel russia is basically trying to break the back Of europe by now messing with their nat gas supplies um the german energy minister Yesterday said that if that happens it could be a contagion equivalent to leaman brothers with respect to energy When you play all of these things out What you have is unfortunately rampant runaway costs That really have no mechanism to get back and check In the absence of some real governmental changes our policy on this ukraine russia war You know how we intend to sort of uh work or cooperate or fight with china all of these things have to get solved So in the absence of that Prices are going to continue to go up And so what does the fed do how does it Throw away what little credibility it has left When there's eight and nine percent inflation prints and saying we think we're done for right now you can't do that So they will overcorrect Because there is just going to be so much pressure for them to act All roads i think lead to lower equity prices and i think what david said astutely is We've seen the first wave But now it has to touch all these other areas for example We have gotten totally drunk on debt as a country one of the most Obvious places where we've been serving alcohol far too late into the night is in the Financing of all these private equity leverage buyouts Right leverages dangerous.

These are sketchy companies that are sort of like, you know teetering on insolvency at times Where private equity comes in levers up the balance sheet with debt They price it right to the edge of what's legally allowed or what's financeable and then they go do it But that's all assuming the economy continues to grow And so if all of a sudden you have some recessionary forces or prices go up and earnings don't You'll have you know a contagion in the debt markets. You could have a contagion in the commodity market So we're dealing with some really Um, real estate boundary conditions.

I mean real estate most Americans have most of their net worth tied up in real estate And if we see a 30 30 correction in real estate, it could be a real problem Particularly with rising interest rates inability to refinance sacks the dual mandate is hey keep inflation 2% And then keep the unemployment rate reasonable the unemployment rates Amazing with still so many jobs out there even with these layoffs. In fact, one might argue we made Too many jobs available to the point at which people maybe aren't working as much or just you know underworking Um, uh and not taking advantage of these amazing jobs out there.

Where do you see this going sacks now? Um that we can't seem to get inflation under control And people are looking at their 401ks. They feel a lot poor, but is the demand side gone yet? Have have consumers decided I'm not going to buy the next house. I'm not going on this vacation $6 gas makes no sense $7 gas makes no sense. I'm not going to go on this weekend Excursion. I'm staying home. Yeah. I mean look consumer confidence just had the biggest drop. I think in 40 or 50 years Um, we if you look at like right track wrong track polling for the country only something like 24% Believes that the country is on the right track right now If you poll people are we in a recession and they don't look at like, you know, the quarter over quarter growth They just look at what they're feeling 56% of the country says we're already in recession It's about 70 percent republicans about 50 percent Democrats so the country is already hurting people already feeling it and this is a psychological sacks Or are they actually making decisions now to spend less? Well, I think it's both.

I mean you start with the real inflation and people feel it and they also hear about it in the media And then they start to adjust their their decisions and this is the problem with fixing Yeah, this is a problem with fixing an inflation problem is that is based on expectations So once people start to expect Inflation then businesses have to start operating as if there's going to be an inflation rate next year So they have to start raising prices and it's actually very hard To put the horse back in the barn and this is why I think the Fed is probably more likely to overshoot On raising rates is because if they really want to stop inflation now They really have to slam on the brakes and then that's going to lead to a recession And if they don't then we end up with like a chronic sort of stagflationary situation Where you get lower growth and inflation persists So it's a bunch of bad options right now and I think to the point free burgers making earlier You know this Ray Dalio piece that he just published as a blog on linkedin He said look what you want is a fed that is alert at the wheel And gently applies the accelerator or the brakes based on what's happening And instead what we had is the Fed was asleep at the wheel They should have started reacting gently to inflation last summer instead they waited Nine months and now they're slamming on the brakes and this is a bunch of bad options I think we you know, we are going to have a recession the way this unravels Can I just make one suggestion? I want to put this out there because I sent it on our text and I anyone that's listening In dc, please think about how we can change the way the federal reserve Operates, but it doesn't make sense to have humans with subjectivity Applying their subjectivity to a set of as Chamath pointed out infrequent data that comes in chunks and comes in spurts And only having a mechanism of changing rates by 25% each month or sorry 25 basis points once a month We should have continuous real time monitoring of economic data And software or AI or some sort of informed set of models should then predict what inflation and economic growth rates will be as that data comes in React in real time and on a daily basis, we should be adjusting the overnight rate in a one basis point increment So we can have the ability to more quickly more efficiently and in a higher resolution way Yeah smooth it out A smoother way and a higher resolution way make these adjustments It's silly that we're still operating the way we did in a pre digital age As it is with a lot of industries and a lot of bureaucracy But in this case, it's particularly prudent and it's becoming particularly Important and relevant as we're seeing right now with the stagflation risk that we're facing We're going to have massive inflation and recession at the same time Because if we had made smaller adjustments every day for a period of time as these economic data indicated that we should be making them more quickly We would not be in this problem And I don't think that having humans and their judgment should necessarily be the way that we drive this thing Yeah, but listen, we don't need them making daily adjustments.

I don't think the Fed can fine tune an outcome like that I just think that they can't be asleep at the wheel for nine months Software could? I mean we should have AI running this friggin thing. I mean what's the... Listen, I actually don't think when you said that you know Congress needs to somehow change the way the Fed does business I actually think that the Fed has the correct mandate, which is the dual mandate of considering inflation and unemployment We shouldn't be basically junking that up by adding a bunch of mandates and actually the administration has been trying to add mandates They basically gave the Fed a mandate around climate change.

They gave them a mandate around equity Don't change the mandate They have been trying to change... Just can't be multivariable. This would be too complex The tools should change Yeah, right. We really want to focus Fed and I think the administration has been politicizing the Fed by giving them a bunch of mandates Look, if you want to pursue those policies do it at HHS, do it in the Interior Department Don't basically confuse the Fed and make them pursue climate change or equity or what have you I mean that is just bad... That is not their remit, right? Their remit is controlling inflation I really think this just comes down to the fact that for nine months they sat on their hands and ignored the inflation evidence Remember this word transitory? You know, we heard so much last year about inflation being transitory How'd they know that? You know, why didn't they start rethinking this quantitative easing? The headline from the Wall Street Journal says it all how the inflation rate is measured 477 government workers at grocery stores.

Yeah Software should be taking data from different feeds and software can learn I don't I don't agree with you and what are the predictors of inflation and what are the predictors of growth and make a recommendation I don't agree with you that it needs to be real time. In fact, I think it would do more harm than good But I do think that we can know these things without sampling in such a porous way And you know, you can work with private companies to give you the feed of data to allow you to do it And now, you know, we're going to look we've had a system of overcorrecting and undercorrecting for years The problem is the stakes get higher and higher as the economy grows and becomes more complicated and And we have more leverage and we have more leverage and we have more industries that are leveraged and more asset classes that are leveraged like housing Because I mean this is such an even a few points you could take everything.

I also want to tell you guys a quick story One of the most interesting canaries in the coal mine of all of this was two days ago and what happened to Facebook And this sort of ties a lot of this stuff together in terms of like economics inflation asset prices equities Tech we should we then we can try to talk about non sort of, you know, big tech But the everybody was saying oh gosh, the market's going to rip on the open You know, we were closed for Juneteenth And then on Tuesday the market, you know, the s&p was up like 250 basis points 2.5

percent And the NASDAQ was also up, you know, call it maybe 300 basis points roughly But Facebook was down like 400 points, right? So it's a big spread And why is that and I was like this makes no sense to me what is going on with this price action? Everything was up Apple was up Google was up And so I called around and you know, I was like, why is this happening? And this is the best explanation I got When you look at who the incremental buyer is In the stock market it tends to give you a sense of whether prices can go up or will continue to go down And the poorest informed buyer Tends to be retail and the most informed buyer tends to be these very large institutional hedge funds right, so there's a spectrum and Facebook is an example of one of the big tech that is poorly owned by retail So it's mostly owned by smart money And the case that smart money makes for owning Facebook is that it's got an extremely cheap price to earnings ratio So you must own it And what they said was that they you know looking at the tea leaves of consumer demand What they actually reunderwrote was that actually It's not that the price to earnings was cheap.

It's that the e in pe was just wrong And if they pass through all of these increases in inflation and you know, their earnings expectations into Facebook It's actually more like fair value at a lower price. That's why they sold it so much on a day where the market was up Now why is that important? Well, eventually you're going to touch all these other stocks as well that are going to go through earnings revisions in this recession This is where I think wall street has done a very poor job on behalf of retail If you look at the average estimates of earnings, you will be shocked to hear that wall street actually has This year being record earnings next year earnings continuing to go up How is that even possible? Well, how is that how is that if you're sitting here? How do you see how do you see? Earnings continuing to go up into these prints like this when you cannot pass through You know 80 90 percent increases in energy and cogs and whatnot.

How does it happen? I think the what people would say is maybe they're going to lower their costs and so with layoffs And and lowering salaries and lowering spend on advertising You know the earning the e could go up if people because start belt tightening and that's what they're saying People because start belt tightening and then we start having companies that are being run You know just more um, you'll have to sell you'll have to sell fewer things because there'll be fewer people with jobs to buy things But we have 10 million job openings. So this is the weird thing about this recession is because we haven't let a lot of people immigrate into the country But is that is that what you think the consensus view on wall street is that basically A bunch of people get fired and so that's why earnings continue to go up Well, they stop hiring for two years in advance, right? Facebook said they were hiring for like 2024 Their hiring plans were looking out two years.

So now if they go on a hiring freeze, maybe there's you know, and that's their number one cost I'm just putting out a theory. I'll give you the counterfactual. I think wall street's wrong Okay, and I think that earnings are going to go down this year and will definitely go down in 23 And so I think what probably happens is the entire world of equities needs to get repriced at a lower price And in that it's going to put enormous pressure on these cash burning non profitable tech companies Well, that's for sure. But in the ones that are profitable chumath, they're aware of this Facebook just cancelled like two of their prototypes They were working on to save money.

So that whole 10 billion dollars into You know VR, I think they're trying to make that number look smaller smaller sacks. What do you think? Well, I think you're bringing up a really interesting point with this the 10 million You know job openings and now that that number is coming down really fast as Companies close open recs and they basically freeze hiring. So that number is going to come down very very fast but one of the major contributors to inflation is that The labor force participation has been very low A millions of people left the labor force during covid as a result of the stimulus checks and the freezing of Rent and evictions.

I mean look rents to the number people's number one expense If they don't have to pay rent for a couple of years, a lot of them may not work or may not work as much So we've had this problem where we really need about two million people to reenter the labor force And if you describe inflation as too much money chasing too few goods We need to increase production and productive capacity and when you have millions of people dropping out of the labor force You've got less goods and services being produced that people want So just reducing the money supply is not going to get us out of this mess.

We also need to improve productive capacity Just to put a number on that we peaked in the 1999 era at 67 percent of participation labor force And then it's been down in this low 60 61 62 and it continues to be low But that is the solution here we get that 7 percent that gap Um, you can't just fix the demand side because if all you do is fix the demand side What you're doing is you're killing the economy to reduce demand in order to bring it down prices That's very painful. It's all pain But what you also have to do is fix the supply side You have to increase the availability of all the critical inputs into the economy So labor obviously is one of them, but also critical resources like energy, you know oil natural gas and so on And that goes back to fixing the supply chain.

Hopefully getting a resolution of the situation in ukraine the war So if we could fix those things it's a way to improve the economy without creating more pain Freeberg if the prices of just daily living of which transportation and housing and healthcare are now the top three i believe Um groceries and healthcare I think have flip flopped a couple times in the last decade in terms of cost If those things go up Would that make people want to go back to work to pay for those things or does it create capitulation where people say I'm moving in with my cousin.

I'm going to lower my balance sheet. What is your prediction there? Are more people going to go to work or do we still have this? You know call it 10 million people in the country who just don't want to go to work I've mentioned this in the past, but I think there's more There's another kind of interesting outcome of this We've had several months in a row of pretty significant increase in consumer credit And I think the the reason is Things are getting more expensive people Generally do not like to reduce their spend on stuff or they're living their lifestyle Once you get used to a lifestyle like going out to dinner once a week or going to the movies every week And you create a budget you create a life experience around that a model around that It's very hard to say okay.

I got a cut budget now and I got to reduce my life I would rather say I'm going to keep doing that or at least there's some inertia or some momentum To keep spending on the things that you've been spending on And the way you do that in a model where you don't have as much income or you have less income and things are getting more expensive Is you take on more debt? And so there is a little bit of a nervousness that I have had that people's response generally um, the consumer response to inflation and to a Kind of a a shifting income environment like this Is not necessarily to cut as quickly but take on more debt and keep keep buying And so I am a little nervous about that, but I do think obviously at some point everyone Has to figure out ways to generate income there have been A lot of these kind of ancillary markets that are typically the first to go these extra services markets where People you know have found other ways to make money side hustles and whatnot Um, that may or may not be as robust as they have been historically Um, and so people may need to go back for more secure stable income And and these jobs get filled I you look I mean as we all know there's an opportunity and this is the whole concept.

I think behind build back better. It's not super Super thoughtful in terms of the approach. I think based on my understanding of where that money is supposed to go Because it doesn't create long term jobs, but there is an opportunity to build um New manufacturing and new infrastructure jobs in the u.s right now That could enable a healthy transition here, but that legislation needs to be done smart It can't be done with this like hey, let's build a bunch of bridges And then a bunch of contractors make a bunch of money and no one has any long term jobs out of it We've got to find ways to spend money on creating long term sustainable um, you know new industry here Yeah, and job openings 11.4.

It's come down about six or seven percent. So, you know, it's going to be trailing But it's for sure we're seeing it in our industry with the hiring freezes That that you know, we're going to work through those open jobs What are the chances that inflation gets under control In the next year and should the fed go for like the 1 slam on the brakes? There was some talk about that Obviously, they went from 75 remember a lot of the elements that we were um Kind of saying oh my gosh, I can't believe the climate prices.

So, you know wheat is down. I think 30% lumber is down 50% Gas prices are coming down. So, you know, there are some of these You know commodity spikes that we've experienced over the past couple of quarters Particularly recently that are really that have had a significant part of the fueling effect on the inflationary Uh trickle down into ultimately end products and whatnot. Uh, and those are coming down um, you know There's a real question of how quickly that flows through the economy and flows through to the price of goods That that consumers ultimately end up paying for The gas prices right now are the biggest concern, right? Like unless you can get gas prices under control that always always has a massive impact on spending On consumer spending which drives a recessionary cycle Um, and so the if I'm the biden administration, I'm first and foremost I don't care about the general inflationary indicators as much as I care about getting the price of gas down That is a super Super critical number to fix Is this are these gas prices going to change how americans look at what car they buy because they're gonna get worse time we had that They're gonna get worse people started looking at not buying suvs.

We could have seven dollar gas Oh, I said there was a picture actually I tweeted in california. There was a seven dollar and 11 cents gas broadly broadly We could have seven dollar gas all throughout the country But jay cal the um, you know remember the average automotive automobile in the u.s. Last for 12 years That's how often people change out their cars So that's eight percent of the fleet being changed per year Yep, and the interest rates for auto loans has spiked like crazy now with this change in the fed rates and as a result the Linquency on auto loan portfolios has spiked like crazy.

Yeah, and so, you know Yes, sure theoretically people will think about buying an electric car But most people aren't thinking about that on average for five or six years from now because that's the average of a 12 year cycle Right five five years from now wait till all these peloton bikes need to get repossessed well all these uh, actually the the the weight for cars and the overpricing of cars has ended in the last two months And there are multiple cars now in the market 25 30k for a 50 plus mile per gallon car I think this actually one of the silver linings coming out of this is people might actually Stop buying as many SUVs or you know, I think our average is in the low 20s right now in europe's is in the high 40s The problem is like, you know every other for miles per gallon part of the government Acknowledges that you have to really ring fence and protect consumers, right? Like if you look at the securities laws They're meant to protect them at all costs Um, and jason you you know you've been frustrated by some of the rules that haven't changed and when they change They change so slowly But the reason is because sometimes that you you want people to make good decisions and If you uh, you know give them a bunch of firepower.

They're just going to spend it and You know what we really did was we gave folks just a ton of money And what did they do they acted rationally they spent it And now we have to take it all back Um, and that's that's I don't think that's going to be as easy or as simple as people think What what percentage of the money supply do you think is in excess right now in the united states? Well, look, I told you this because I wrote this in my annual letter But it's it's stunning that you know the reason the stock market went up Dollar for dollar was actually tied to the growth in the m2 money supply.

The correlation was 0.92 So for every dollar that that the fed printed the stock market went up by 92 cents So, you know it stands to reason that if the Fed is going to take three to five trillion dollars of value out Then we have to re rate the equity markets by three to five trillion dollars at a minimum And then you have to re rate and re baseline for earnings. And so that's probably another 20 or 30% Yeah, let's talk about the end game here. Um, the rates go up people stop buying homes people go back to work and uh Energy prices come back down because people are not buying as much of it Spending goes down and people rebalance and that takes a year the job openings could also disappear by the way I mean like they're going down 400 000 a month is Yeah, you're you're assuming that all of a sudden like demand is stable But it's not necessarily stable and it and in a demand and in a demand contraction Yes, people get fired, but then also new job openings change, right? Yes, fewer of them They're they're more specific in the way that people salaries go down, right? That's the next piece go down That's the piece i'm waiting for that to me that would be I don't know if you guys have early warning signs But the two early warning signs I have in my you know Job of investing in early stage companies is when people Well, what's the average salary for an engineer if that hasn't gone down by now then it's that's a lagging indicator, right? Well, that would be to me capitulation salaries go down or people instead of laying people off sacks They do salary cuts at a company that is really hard to do right? That's yeah I don't think they do so or liquidation preferences and deals right? I think the way the salaries come down is that startups freeze their hiring plans Or they lay people off and now all of a sudden the war for talent subsides these are to hire people And so there's no need to keep raising up salaries are you seeing that? Yeah, I think we're seeing the beginning of it, but I gotta tell you I mean I think that startups have not fully Embraced or realized what's what's happening.

I just got back from the co2 summit over the past couple of days This was an event that was hosted by co2 You know whose founders are um, philip and thomas lafont very smart guys very smart investors who've been Public market sort of hedge fund investors for a long time But also have a large venture fund to do growth stage investing Some of the takeaways from that conference Some of the more vivid lines that stuck with me Is that one of the speakers said that He said that when it comes to runway for startups three to four years is the new two years Because if you just have two years of runway, you're going to need to raise in a year And in a year from now, we're going to be in the middle of a recession They're predicting they're forecasting that capital availability is going to decline about 75 percent the amount of money That's venture money that's available the ecosystem down by three quarters So if you try to raise in that environment either you're not going to be able to or investors are going to You know have all the leverage you're not going to get terms that you like So they were recommending three to four years of runway So that is not what I think a lot of companies are planning for just not even possible The other thing that the other really vivid takeaway is that they did some polling of the startup founders who are in attendance, okay, and What the numbers basically showed is a is a contradiction on the one hand the founders sort of understood That intellectually that we're headed into a downturn.

We're headed to a recession And so the polling reflected that on the other hand if you ask the founders how they're going to react to it What are you going to do about it? You're going to cut a head count or you're going to accelerate your business to beat competitors? Everybody said oh, we're going to out accelerate our competitors So everybody thought that they're the exception in other words everyone understood We're headed for this massive recession. It's going to be really bad, but we're going to be the one company that doesn't need to cut We're actually going to grow we're going to accelerate during the downturn So there was a real contradiction in How founders are interpreting this advice and I have to tell you when I talk to founders in our own portfolio What I see is you know, we've now done multiple meetings where we lay out what's happening in the economy and they get it They understand it and when we do a board meeting, they're like, okay We're going to go look at our plan and we're going to reevaluate and we're going to make major cuts We're going to bring our burn multiple down to you know, the where it should be But then you know when you're checking with them a couple of months later and you're like, where are you on the plan? I haven't taken the medicine It's or the medicine is like a 10 cut and I'm like guys like 10 percent's a performance review Yeah, like 10 percent you should be doing every year anyway.

Yeah, you get rid of the the bottom like the c performers you promote the a's and b's and you get rid of the c so no one really wants to take the medicine yet and Um, you know, it's a problem. I mean sequoia has this great chart called survival of the quickest That we should put up on the screen and it shows two lines One company is the one that takes the medicine right away Brings their burn down to where it should be and then they're able to grow from there and they really will out accelerate the competitors, but then there's the company that basically Delays and waits and what happens is by the time they finally get religion to make the cuts It's too late because even after they make the cuts, they don't have enough runway on the other side burn the capital Yeah, they burn the capital and then they're in a death spiral So I think you know what what companies need to think about is this is a 75 reduction Imagine if you did a hundred million dollar round last year, right? If you go try to raise next year in the middle of the recession that a hundred million dollar round might look like a $25 million round So imagine if you're burning an extra 25 to 50 million more than you should be according to your burn multiple You're basically burning the next round forget about the fact that the last round gave you all this cushion Think about how much of the next round you're burning and if you re or you're thinking around that It could lead to a change of behavior anecdotally, I'm seeing people come back from Rounds where they were expecting 40 or 50 million dollars in some cases like with 250k in revenue 500k in revenue.

They were living in a 200 300 times revenue kind of world. It was just insane and Um, you know, they're now coming back with 10 million dollar caps 15 million dollar caps on their notes I was offered a hundred million dollars At a 50 discount and I said call me when you get to 65 and that's the best company That's literally the best company. That's the best and the best founders to bet on right of probably most private companies You don't like that valuation chamoff What is that valuation 40 at 50 percent off? I it's less of a judgment on but it's just more an observation that we're at the beginning of the beginning Again, we're at the beginning of the beginning Okay, for all of us that lived through the 2000.

This was four years of sheer hell and a grind Now we have 30 trillion dollars that we have to work through the economy a recession We have to overcome a war we need to end And people all of a sudden assume that two or three rate hikes and five or six months of headlines are enough And on the margin, maybe they're right But from my perspective, you know, it's less a judgment on but it's just an observation that we're at the beginning of something That just fundamentally has to take some amount of time to work its way through the system And so I don't understand why anybody Would give up their liquidity in this moment right now.

Why would you why would I why would I give up 100 million dollars of cash in my bank again? I would not do that right now Because the cash the caps the cash gives you so much optionality. It's basically so much optionality So you're going to be looking for distress and this is the thing So you have a huge amount of capital leaving the ecosystem like we know tiger is basically out I mean, they were the basically the default provider of growth stage capital over the last couple of years So you have a lot of liquidity leaving the system and then the liquidity that's in the system is waiting for distress So you're right There's a quarter.

I mean like we talked about there's a quarter trillion dollars of quote unquote dry powder I mean, I know chumat thinks that people are going to give that money back, but there's never been There's not there's not that much a lot. That's deployed They're not going to give it back. I just deployed. Yeah, look at that that tiger fund tiger raised a new 12 billion dollar fund that was announced in march and tech crunch We covered it on the show a month ago. Yeah, the tech crunch on an article saying it was already deployed in six months So I wasn't on that show.

Oh that was the one where jake i'll try to replace you with bragg ursiner We should we should do the show weekly going forward instead of monthly might be better to keep up with these trends Okay, jake. How you made a good point there. Creets go back this for a second You said the founders were they're still anchored on this world of two to 300 times a r evaluations Let me just tell you where the new valuation levels are and this is obviously in flux But I'm pretty sure the valuation levels are at 20 to 30 times a r r.

That's for a company that's growing 3x year over year 3x year over year. That's the best of the best The reason how you get there 10x next year is a r. Basically. Yes, exactly And the way that you get there is that if you look at like The um the multiples for like the best public sass companies that are like say a 40% grower like a snowflake They're at 8x. Yeah, so, you know, so basically giving more credit for The higher growth rate. Yeah, right, but they really have to have that 3x growth So, you know, if you're a founder think about the fact that when you try to go raise next year Assuming you're the best of the best you'll get 20 to 30 times a r r.

Now think about you're spending Not last round's money. You're spending the next round's money If you could just reorient your thinking that way you'd burn a lot less money Yeah, the the I literally had a deal, you know in the 30 and 40 range and angel investors who'd never early stage angel investors seed funds That did not look at multiples are now Asking me because when I send a deal memo to 10,000 people for my syndicate People hit reply people are hitting reply now and saying I did the math on this. This is the multiple This is this.

This is the berm multiple. They're actually doing the math So we all of a sudden have discipline that I have not seen in this investor class In the 10 years I've been doing it. So that is to me One of the great silver linings here. I think people are going to do a better job with their personal balance sheets They're going to invest less than speculative stuff and they're going to invest more In the actual builders who have discipline. So we're going to see this massive swing to discipline And we're going to flush out all the people who don't have product market fit think about all those folks like what's happened in the last Six months.

It's like they've been long unprofitable tech. It's got smoked by 75 to 85 percent They've been long crypto that's gotten smoked by 65 more. Yeah I mean if they weren't using a calculator, then they sure as hell should be using a calculator now to figure out a company No, I mean people are well you think about it There's a whole group of investors who have only known the upmarket There's a whole group of founders who only know the growth market if you're under 40 years old You don't understand what you're about to experience And here we are.

Let's that's a perfect time to segue into crypto bitcoin's price is down 71 percent from the all time high $89k in November of 2021 bottomed out at 17 000 or so on June 18th the theorems price down 78 percent And if you look at the craziness since the last all in episode, you know, this three ac three arrow capital They're a crypto hedge fund that was letting people Uh, basically loan out their crypto they Are basically closing a 10 billion dollar crypto Hedge fund at its peak they're insolvent according to the reports taro luna collapsed the founders and employees at that company are not being allowed to Leave south korea doesn't mean they're guilty, but it's certainly not looking good and um There is a whole situation with salana and a company built on top of it.

So lend which is not salana It's an application built on top of it. I talked to vinny lingham our friend earlier this week about it They had a whale who had Um, tried to loan out 100 million and they had to freeze their account because they thought the downward pressure Since there was not many buyers in crypto right now could collapse salana. So thoughts on crypto writ large What is this going to look like sacks? Over the next year for crypto crash all over again. I mean, basically you had an extremely promising technology I mean, it is a promising technology.

Of course. It is a future, you know technology platform, but the Price action got totally decoupled from the level of progress in the space and people were not valuing these things based on Real customers real usage and real use cases, but it was became, you know, very speculative and again all this was fueled By the excess liquidity that was pumped into the system So, you know, we've said it before that crypto is like a liquidity sponge It sucks up when there's a lot of excess liquidity. It sucks up that liquidity, but now that sponge is getting wrong out And um, you know, part of the problem is with interest rates going up, you know, it's one thing when you have negative real interest rates And and and you can't earn a return on your money Then you start to get you basically people start to push the envelope and invest in more and more speculative things but as you can get a real return in Like they'll say there's like a real risk free rate Now there's alternatives for all that cash and then you've got the problem of leverage as well Which I think over the last few weeks the crypto space was heavily overlevered and a lot of people got marching called and wiped out That's the contagion that's occurred and people were levered up five ten times their Bitcoin on these roads wait till these token sale things get litigated.

I mean the amount of the amount of grift by So many of these venture firms in running these sketchy deals where they would put in Some amount of money This is my understanding of the scam because it was explained to me you put in a little bit of equity at some crazy price And then you get these tokens and apparently there's no like you can just sell these tokens day one And so what happens is like You you price the equity, but it's meaningless because really what you're getting is the right to get some amount of these tokens The price is crazy you sell it and then you just kind of walk away and apparently, you know You do these deals where you just rinse and repeat this thing Um, well wait wait till that gets exposed I mean that seems like a firm the firm that did this the most is entries and Horowitz Uh, Chris Dixon, I think was considered like the best investor last year or the year before Because of all these token returns I I got a wonder when they go Now that this People are losing money.

That's when people start suing. I mean, what is it going to look like? If they were what what do you think their marks look like last year versus right now? I mean and all these coins like looking back in the review mirror and saying hey, you bought all these coins You flipped some number of coins. I mean to your point Jamal like what is the litigation path and the The shadow economy that was created. What is an article? There's an article and I think it was in Bloomberg Um about folks trying to figure out how to get um A lawsuit filed against binance And the problem was that they didn't even know what entity to sue Um, it's not clear who owns what and you know, what owns the other and who the ultimate look through ownership structure is and Um, and it doesn't mean that binance is guilty of anything But the article was just you know showing how there was a u.s.

Investor who lost 1.2 million dollars Who wanted to file a lawsuit and they have every right to do that? Um, couldn't even find the corporate entity to to actually file this lawsuit against So if that's what's happening in a trillion dollar market, there's um It's gonna be a lot of pain free. It's it's a lot of oversight. That's that's that free free bird What is this going to do to regulation and crypto at this point because crypto regulators now? Or regulators are going to just be looking at this going wow look at all the pain and suffering and when a local da Gets you know five or six of their people complaining they lost money in terra luna or whatever it is This is like the perfect opportunity for them to collect a pelt and get some crypto kid and You know hold them responsible and get some great headlines.

I mean What do you what do you think happens from this point forward in the crypto land? What you just said Okay, there you have it folks. Yeah, but what about regulation? I guess that's the next piece because All of these entities have taken a very the sec last july or august published this kind of initial opinion letter But remember there's also the cftc. There's a bunch of regulatory authorities in the united states That have a longer process than governments x us That have had a much more kind of stringent point of view that there's a lot of casino like gambling going on with these things And that's it.

There's no functional utility. There's not a it's not Is it a security if there's no underlying business if it's not a security then it's just a bet on something if it's a bet on something It's gambling It's you know obvious that if it's a security it has to be governed by the sec If it's a future or commodity, it's the cftc And the problem is we need congress to pass some legislative framework That puts the puck in one side of the of the arena a rink or the other Yeah And otherwise otherwise all this gray is going to exist for a long time and people You know if if if governments really hate it when retail investors Lose money while watch out because they just had two trillion dollars in the us We have a lot of other regulators that can prosecute cases like the dfs in new york This is the department of financial services.

They are a pretty litigious prosecutorial group. I mean they go after scams and People praying on consumers and retail investors in a very aggressive way Often outside of the purview of the sec. They often coordinate with the doj or the sec in evaluating enforcement Decisions, but they will prosecute And and I think that there is a You know as you said a lot of opportunity when people have been grifted out of their money for politically motivated and you know People that generally have kind of the right point of view that are in a position to prosecute to go after Uh the offenders.

So you're right There will be there will be a lot of action on this over the next couple of years And then chumat is right the way it gets resolved is a congressional act But by the way, I'll just point out in the year 2000 congress passed what was called the commodity futures modernization act And that cfma was really meant to kind of quote Bring commodities and futures into the digital age and they started working on it in 1996 It took four years to get it done Within four years it was already out of date and a lot of what was going on with respect to how exchanges operate and the types of Contracts are being created.

It was already missed. So, you know, the problem we have here is that by legislating the state of the market today Um without creating enough flexibility in how enforcement action can be pursued and how things can be interpreted in the future You could end up in a similar situation where people just find and run around and the whole thing repeats itself in the next few years Because guess what people will always want to gamble and grifters will always want to grift And so there will always be a way to try and scan people out of their money Yeah, and that's just skydating's poker game.

Hey, oh By the way, are you J. Cal's always gonna want to jay Cal Oh, you get out of here what you're calling Everybody download calling you can get the after jim podcast J. Cal's gonna jay Cal Before we pivot if you want a perfect example of this and this is just a lesson to founders out there If you feel like you're in a gray area, you probably are Um people were like oh nfts, you know, they're just trading cards yada yada And it's not a big deal that somebody at open sea decided to front run the market Oh, they just bought a trading card ahead of everybody else who cares.

We know who cares Turns out the southern district of new york cares and they are a pretty serious group of people former employee of nft marketplace Uh, open sea was charged in the first several digital asset insider trading scheme. So just because insider trading Didn't exist as a concept for nfts before Congratulations doesn't exist in crypto. I mean if they want to really find Uh, the honeypots here. I mean, it's the worst kept secret in crypto how much Insider trading is going on amongst the organizations that run the exchanges and their side pockets That they use to manage liquidity.

I mean, this is the it's the biggest thing that's been happening in crypto If you're wondering why people were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a board ape or whatever like There might have been some shenanigans going on here And I mean no, but Jason it's not it's not illegal. This is my understanding though It's not illegal to front run crypto trade So most of these organizations that that run an exchange Right compete for order flow And they're able to just look at that order flow and then they front run the trade and they're on the other side of that So they're always making money and so they were making Tens of billions of dollars all these exchanges were yeah, and then I guess the question becomes sacks You know in terms of since you're an attorney like how you interpret this stuff There may not be a law on the books about front running nfts But there are laws on the books about fraud and nft and conspiracy to you know Grift people out of their money.

So this is all going to come crashing down and the discovery Is going to be next if the southern district of new york actually subpoenaed any of these exchanges all hell would break loose Oh, no, they are you could be sure that's in process if they go after one nft Flipper no no no forget nfts. I'm saying coins crypto like that's the huge market And they will they're turning over these cards because you know how they like to work They like to flip their way up to the top person But we're not talking about january 6th here.

We're talking about gas in the ukraine next. Hey, oh, hey, ho That's a little reference for you um Listen now that we're now that we're an hour and ten in and we've we've kind of like broken the ice and we're friends again I feel good. I feel like you want to play against a team again. You want to redo our intros so you're not being such a bitch I don't care. I don't care. Can we just move forward? I think we all understand I thought you like to be recognized. You said you said that you were workshopping an intro So do you want to do your intros at the end of this or not? I'm not doing the intros.

No, I'm gonna strike on it. No, I didn't they were they were there's what it was I wanted to the intro is an extra point. You need an extra point. No, it's not about the point. That was a joke I wanted to do intros. I didn't know coming into this How sensitive people would be and then sacks is like I need to have in the contract an NDA and I'm scared about the things I said so spike content needs to be a bit took that out You were the spike content guy. You're the most concerned.

Oh, well, yeah. No, we have an agreement on that Is a good rule non disparagement. He didn't want to have in there. I and oh, he didn't want I took it out to disparage you day and night. I mean, he's really honest I took it out because I thought you would be more sensitive about accusing others of disparaging you I might this whole show is you disparaging these guys have an intro or not for I don't have intros prepared No, I'll do intros next episode. I promise everybody I wanted to take the temperature of my besties I don't know if people are sensitive right now.

You want me to make a joke about brad gershner We got real shit to talk about we talk about Ukraine and war three. It's not all about our narcissistic nonsense as for David over to teenage boys running amok Go ahead. So something happened in the last week that I think is pretty disconcerting I mean just intellectually speaking we all know that wars that go on and on have a tendency to escalate and there was an example of how this could happen over the past week Lithuania is now essentially stopping the flow of goods From the russian mainland to another part of russia called kulintengrad, which is it's called an oblast It's a little area, but it's outside the russian mainland.

It's basically between poland and lithuania and So goods go by rail From the russian mainland to kulintengrad and they've been stopping these goods because they say they're under e.u. Sanction the problem is Listen when you think about a sanction a sanction is me not buying goods from you because I don't like what you're doing That's fair game. Everyone has a choice over who they want to buy from but this is not that this is uh, lithuania deciding to stop goods going from russia to russia And so the russians say this is a blockade. I think with some justification and blockades are understood to be an active war so you've got lithuania Basically engaging in this act of escalation against russia.

We always thought it would be poland But it's right exactly and remember lithuania is is a member of natus. They have an article five guarantee Now think about the upside versus downside of this action In terms of from the western point of view the upside is this has absolutely no impact on the outcome Of the war. This is not going to help anyone in ukraine to blockade kulintengrad and prevent coal and building materials and steel from reaching kulintengrad. That's not going to have any impact on the war So there's zero upside to this from a military standpoint But the downside is that you now have lithuania and russia getting into it And if they get into a war then we are instantly pulled in Under article five or in middle war three So this is the kind of dangerous escalatory act that has no upside only downside for us And my view on it is that we have to tell we have to instruct frankly Our treaty allies not to engage In these types of dangerous acts because there's a huge externality.

We could be pulled in this is very dangerous And I just wonder if the administration is on top of this Did they give the green light to the lithuanians to do this or were they caught by surprise? And what is the reaction to acts like this? You know what I worry is that we're conducting foreign policy by virtue signaling where we just say who are the good guys? And who are the bad guys? And you know if the russians are the bad guys lithuanians are the good guys so therefore this is okay It's like playing cops and robbers on a global stage.

I think we need to be asking the question Is this smart or is it dumb? Is this prudential or is it reckless? Is this in our interests or is it not in our interests? and you know, I really got a wonder About who's mining the store on this day 120 And it feels like this is just doesn't have an ended site. Is there an ended site here? What's the end? I mean the The end is a big issue. What do the two parties want? Yeah, what are the two parties want at this point? I mean the people in russia are suffering during this the people in the ukraine are being murdered In ukraine are being murdered.

I mean, how does it end at this point? The problem is that biden Engaged the united states in a proxy war Without our real explicit discussion Number one and then number two is then we pulled and we pressured europe to really draw a hard line But then now are kind of working around it so that the Countries that suffer the most are europe now. I think you starting to see the tea leaves though last week There was a group of european leaders. I think it was macron dragy And I can't remember if it was the german chancellor or not and one other person who went um to ukraine and If I had to bet I think the message was kind of like all right, listen like we need to find an organized detente here Because there is you know according to europe a leman like situation in terms of economic Contagion that could manifest over the next months So I think that the end game is probably some Organized negotiated detente and ceasefire I don't think anybody will be happy with it, but I think by and large russia is And has won you know meaning they've won economically.

They're selling oil Like it's not you know, like it's going out of style. It's just not selling it to europe and to america You know, they're selling it to china. They're selling it to africa. They're selling it to india fine with it They'll they'll take some well also chumat they've won. They're winning on the battlefield There was an article in the washroom post There was an article in the washroom post in the last week or so And the washroom post is basically the house organ of the washroom establishment and the the blob Basically saying that hopes are dimming for ukraine on the battlefield the russians have now won 20 to 25 percent of the country.

They've won that eastern that donbas region They've done it with the help of russian separatists in ukraine and the amazing thing in this article was that they were saying That the ukranians were days away from running out of ammunition despite the 40 billion that we just appropriated to them Where did that money go and the and conversely they're saying russia is having just unbelievable casualties And they're running out of weapons and they are obviously out of kiv now And they're in the donbas mostly so I don't think the russians are running out of anything the russians the the the russians so listen I I said on this pod.

Well, they said they're out of tanks, right? And then the troops well, they've adjusted their strategy and they've they're they're they're learning They're adapting to this new kind of warfare this asymmetric warfare where you can take out a tank with a drone, you know But but look, you know remember on this pod three weeks into the war Everybody who was in favor of this proxy war was saying how great it was And they were saying it was going to lead to a new birth of freedom in the west that it was strengthening our alliances You had francis fukuyama predicting that we are going to win the war and it would lead to this rebirth of freedom In the west we should have known at that moment everything that fukuyama Basically predicts the opposite always wrong.

He's always always wrong. It's like negative one correlation Yeah, and remember I said three weeks in that we were potentially I think put made the mistake in the first three weeks of thinking this would be a cakewalk But that we were making the mistake of thinking the next phase would be a cakewalk and sure enough Here we are. Russia has now won the eastern part of the country just to build on what you said You know we engage in economic sanctions and I was the first one to say Hey, this could really work and this could be a roadmap for how to do it and it turned out This is the roadmap for how not to do it You can't on the front door say here are these sanctions and then walk around the back door And basically open the door for them these these sanctions were so porous as to be like swiss cheese We focused on virtue signaling acts like confiscating a plane or a boat or a house But we didn't focus on the structural things we needed to actually Um, you know make the mandate that we believe to be just to come to life And so russia's completely worked around it their economy Effectively, you know is thriving So what have we gained? How is it thriving? I mean, I don't know that thriving is how they would describe their economy right now Yeah, I mentioned they're printing Records the rubles that are five year high jason.

They're selling gas. They're selling phosphate They're actually making a market and the prices have doubled and tripled in those commodities because the flow has been restricted So because there's exact opposite of what we tried to do And by the way, I'll point I'll point out something that I pointed out in february Which was the biggest concern for me at the time when we stopped allowing trading in the securities of russian companies We yanked away 400 billion dollars of market cap that was held primarily by pension funds and retirement funds in the us and europe And gave that value to russia for free We basically said here you go here all these securities were no longer allowed to trade in them.

So guess what? You guys can trade in them. You can have they got all of their gas and energy and nick nickel and mining companies for free I think it's such a good for it dollars for these companies It's unbelievable. We ripped the stock out of retirement funds and we gave it to the russians and said here you go, putin Take all of these securities for free Enjoy oh and by the way because of our idiotic sanctions and the way we're employing them The commodity prices are going to double and triple and all these companies are going to have record profits this year Happy fucking birthday.

The rubles up five x. It's not a five x. But yeah, okay It's a great point because if putin had retaliated against the west by nationalizing 400 billion Of western assets in russia everyone would have been up in arms But he didn't even have to do that because we just gave him we gave a 400 billion totally I mean, how did this policy make sense? It's this policy of conducting again the conducting for russian securities I'm a i'm friggin black rock. I own a billion dollars of russian securities The u.s. government just took it out of my portfolio that my clients own stakes in and gave it to the russians for free They're gone poof Crazy, I think listen.

I think we've got like a two level problem on this ukraine war one is that our policy hasn't made sense We should have been using diplomacy last year to avoid it This we had all these false hopes Around strengthening the west and the western alliance by allowing this war to happen We then instead of trying to shut it down through a negotiated settlement We try to use as a proxy war to weaken pootin instead. It's done the opposite So there's a whole series of policy failures here But there's another deeper level to the failure which is the personnel who are implementing these policies the washington establishment The blob who've been of both parties the sort of uniparty who've been implementing these policies There has been no dissent within the washington establishment The only guy who really spoke up in a decisive way was john mirshimer the professor of international relations from university chicago And he was treated as a pariah by the blob in the washington establishment everything he predicted has come true Years ago years ago.

Yeah, I predicted the u.s. Was leading ukraine down the primrose path and the result was that ukraine was going to get Wrecked and so it has can I just read the first paragraph of this bloomberg article that I just posted rush's current account surplus more than tripled In the first four months of the year To 95 The central bank said as prices for oil and gas imports and imports plunged under the weight of sanctions Well, you know if you're pootin and you're looking at this you're like wow, maybe I should be under sanctions more often Totally, you know what country should I invade next because this is all the sanctions all that sanctions were Was a restriction on the free market and when you restricted the free market You basically created a spike in price But the market his market could still operate with a narrower set of trading partners He is selling energy to certain trading partners.

He's selling phosphates He's making money They are exporting product and they're making more Because certain people can't buy and they've got to go drive the price up elsewhere So not not only did our sanctions package not work and not only is the treasury treasure Treasury sorry flailing around now trying to find even more backdoors We actually opened a very dangerous precedent which is now we allowed oil to settle in currencies that are not just the united states dollar And now Russia and China are trading and settling in cny. That's not good for us. This is not how you preserve the integrity of the reserve currency of america I don't understand the eu of cutting all of their energy and then becoming dependent on russia Then creating a ban and sanctions But then they made a carve out that oil delivered by pipeline Janet Yellen has been negotiating this carve out.

We have been enabling russia to sell We know the eu passed this legislation Jason look look in the wall street journal today the article is reading the cmbc right now about it like the eu Passes landmark sanctions package in may but they also allowed The stuff that's coming by pipeline for some reason to be a carve out if the eu wants to Contain putin from invading countries on their doorstep They got to actually become energy independent. That's the the beginning and end of this not popular And this is the problem with populism. It's not popular It's not popular to continue to have to to to have energy independent nuclear was not popular And so the politicians the legislators responded in a short sighted way to the popular opinion of the day And this is the challenge.

Absolutely. Yeah, huge mistake on germans part They closed three nuclear reactors popular sentiment in europe got highly affected by these environmental groups exactly That's my point but in the us I think the people of the country want us to be energy independent And and it's elite opinion that bought into these foolish ideas That basically we should cancel energy independence. We should cancel the keystone pipeline job number one so new drilling America should be a net energy exporter 100% job number one is to be energy independent And job number two is to move to but look at by now.

I'm not there's another piece to this You got to do this in sequence. Yeah, so when he came in he said that he was going to make the Saudis a pariah Yeah, on the world stage. Remember this now. He's going hat in hand to them to try and get them to produce more Or the price So what was the point of this foreign policy? It was contradictory. He cancels their energy independence He basically insults the salt the Saudis on which were even more dependent for oil And then he basically refuses to engage in diplomacy on ukraine.

These policies are contradictory Even if your goal was to basically isolate the russians you would then want to improve our relationship 100 were Saudi and you'd want to produce more of our own oil 100% yeah, you you overplayed us and for sure. I mean you can't not have Heat in the winter in Germany and the Germans That's coming by the way, that's coming. You think things are bad right now wait until winter And then that's only an increased Putin's leverage and that's when you're going to see a real fracture in the western alliance This idea that ukraine strengthened the western alliance.

I think you will start to see the fractures come this winter national Germany's got to put those The slow march of nationalism will continue and this will be another catalyzing event for your nukes back on and and and I also think that You know and thinking about the western alliance I think that you know countries like germany and france are really going to question us leadership when they have basically a huge Economic recession and they're wondering how they're going to heat their homes in the winter But I think in the us it's time to reevaluate some of the alliances that we've gotten ourselves in again with this lithuania situation Do you really think that lithuania would be basically poking that big russian bear? If they didn't have the us standing behind them as a bodyguard no way They would be much more circumspect and prudential and the and the fact the matter is that these eastern european countries The baltic countries and poland they have enmities.

They have friction with russia going back hundreds of years and these guys basically They have very provocative attitudes towards russia and Our alliance with them can draw us in so we have to really keep a close lid on that We do not want them making moves on their own Because we could get drawn into a world war here Yeah, and by the way to your point sacks sacks also, you know, there continues to be escalating issues with debt and concerns about debt repayment across the eu And while germany is you know looking to the us for support and worried about energy prices They're gonna end up having to foot the bill To support a bunch of these eu member nations that are facing debt crises and will continue to face significant debt crises over the years ahead I mean grease made a payment recently, but grease's debt to gdp still over 200 percent Italy's at 155 percent portugal's at 134 percent.

I mean the numbers are Uh, pretty significant and as rates climb today, uh, you know, it was yeah The the spread on it italian debt has spiked over the last couple weeks spike bridge water basically is biggest Germany's got another freaking crisis to fight now And I think you're right the the western alliance is more than just uh military at this point There's this, you know, do I really want to be the economic savior over and over again? Of my smaller member states and guess who's gonna benefit in all of this china? Yeah They're gonna look at this fracturing and they're gonna be like great By the way, just speaking of speaking of china for a second, you know, we talk and we we Bloviaid about our desire for energy independence and you know, we Exclude tesla from you know any sort of major meaningful legislation.

We trumpet, you know, these companies that are just completely woefully behind in building energy independence we Think about like a gas tax holiday, but as like kind of like a you know Something that still needs an act of congress to pass even though congress has said they have absolutely no intention of passing it Meanwhile, we keep losing our footing to china just today C atl, which is one of the largest battery manufacturers announced a pretty meaningful improvement in their, you know, 3.0 battery design these guys are now building batteries that can go a thousand kilometers um in both of the major, you know Uh compositions that really matter nmc and lfp and and I just look at these things and i'm like wow We cannot actually get capacity funded to build domestic battery capability Because we're too busy kind of basically virtue signaling on things that don't matter um, and in return Nothing happens china continues to lap us.

We uh It's really it's a really Bad state of affairs. We are we are in a very odd period in terms of government effectiveness If you think about china's foreign policy, how have they lost out by not being part of all these conflicts? How they lost out? They're buying prices of oil That were nine months ago to 18 months ago And so there not only has russia's output price been capped But that's okay china's input cost has been capped And so they don't suffer the same rate of inflation that the rest of us do so to your point david You know our quote unquote, you know exclusionary sanctions were ineffective They were porous and we allowed our largest competitive Friendly if you will to basically be able to you know drive their entire economy at 30 to 40 percent of the uh A discount to what we have to pay to do the same Right when when china goes abroad they go abroad in search of economic resources and economic development That's the point of belt and road.

They don't insert themselves in these middle of these conflicts that they don't understand They were never involved in the middle east. They were never involved in like policing You know all these different countries that has cost us a fortune And now the bill is finally coming due in the form of this inflation We are gonna have some form or another of austerity in this country And it's partly because of this highly militarized foreign policy in which we have sent ourselves abroad to be the world's policeman We can no longer afford to do that. Can I make a generalization sacks you react and tell me if this is true or not? If you have a country that has existed in some way shape or form, you know, the the borders could be blurry, but roughly for hundreds and hundreds of years and in some cases thousands of years where internally The population of that country views themselves You know in a great way they don't feel like their country is a meaningless nothing country any attempt to economically humiliate such a country Tends to have failed in the past and will continue to fail and there tends to be Other countries who view it as one of these things where well if them then why not us and then they sort of you know In a in a backhanded way support everybody.

So we end up in this odd situation where we are picking fights. We cannot win Totally and and the consequences for us are economically really damaging Right, and the consequences for everybody else to stay on the sidelines is like economic prosperity. That doesn't make any sense Right You're afraid that russia is going to roll over more countries and that you have this existential risk That this dictator is going to attack more countries. So okay, you're living in eastern europe You might have a different view of it. Yeah, so you might very much accept and want some help from You know nato and other folks who but you're not getting that help.

That's the problem with that That's the sad part about all I mean if it's poorly executed. It's not working at this point in time. Yeah I mean, that's a valid Okay as an entity they have Almost the same GDP and output as the u.s. And if you compare them to russia their economy their their GDP is 10 times greater than russia They are rich They can afford to allocate a few percent of their GDP of their government budget to defense They should be able to defend themselves They really should and so this idea that we have to go over to europe and bankrupt ourselves to defend rich europeans They should be picking up 100 of the cost of that 100 percent I don't know why we're paying For rich europeans when our country is massively in debt Why aren't we passing the bill to them for that? Yeah, yeah, we're absolutely Yeah Do we have to spend that much money to do that? No, and then obviously the wars in the middle east were Let me pick up on this policeman idea.

What kind of policing works the best? Community policing when the policemen are from the neighborhood and they know all the players they understand the subtlety of the area exactly The u.s. Has made itself the world's policeman. We parachute into areas that we don't understand We did in the middle east. It was very ineffective. What we should do is let the regions Deal with the problems themselves first and we should be the policemen of last resort not first resort Let the europeans take the lead they should pay for their own defense You know, we could still have nato, but they should be paying for it They should be the first responders and if they can't handle it then we can back them up But this idea that we need to be on the bleeding edge of all these conflicts banker bankrupting ourselves.

It's a foolish idea Energy independence is a solution to all of this We wouldn't have to deal with these desk spots if we didn't if we had energy independence So we're getting we're getting circles run around us by china jason on the innovations front Example I just told you the catl battery that they just announced today. Yeah, it's incredible Yeah, I mean battery technologies. We have a lot going on there as well. I mean, it seems like the battery technology Issue has been solved for evies for some time now I mean if an evie can go 200 miles and we can build them at scale, which seems like we're on the precipice of We're going to be good.

You don't need more than 200 miles on average It's just a little bit of a problem We're going to be good. You don't need more than 200 miles on average. It's just a luxury every mile after that Given how fast superchargers are working. So just practically speaking 95 of americans will do just fine with a Electric car that does 200 mile range and the other 5% can do a hybrid or can still burn oil We just need to get more we have to be more serious about the miles per gallon right now. We are just absolutely Abhorrent in our use of fuel in this country.

It's just crazy that we have low 20 miles per gallon as our average when other countries are 30 40 50, you know or 30 and 40 It's because we like our you know seven seat suburbance Which is ridiculous because 99 out of 100 missions in that suburban are done with one or two people in it The fact that our ubers, you know in our lifts or whatever are coming with giant suburbance with one person in it is just I have a I have a fiat e500 Here like a little mini. Oh, it's incredible. Yeah, it's incredible.

I mean, yeah I mean, this is why I mean this is the path if we can just if you just think about it if we were to double our Miles per gallon there are cars right now that are doing 50 55 miles per gallon We really have to be more punitive in terms of tax Give me the give me the forecast jay cal. What's gonna happen with biden? Oh, okay, so I guess give me your scorecard. Give me your grade. How's he doing? For biden? Oh, it's disastrous. I mean, I think the only thing more disastrous than biden would be having trump do a second third and fourth term 100% so but so play it out played out Well, I don't think he's gonna run again.

I think they're gonna have you don't think biden's gonna run again I think they're I think between then and now if the economy keeps going the way it's going He would be a lame duck and impossible and I think he might say you know what? I'm gonna retire to spend time with my kids and my golden years And they might convince him that him running again is a really bad idea and Kamala Harris is a disaster as well She hasn't proven anything in the first two years. Yeah, who would the Dems put up? J. Cal J.

Cal as a democrat. Who would you want to have put up? I think it's gonna be the santa's versus nuisim in 24 I yeah, I But sorry explain that Okay, so well, which part of it nuisim or santa's? You say how does nuisim get the nod? Okay here. So nuisim has a very weak challenger in in california It's a plus 30 dem state hold on so you win the whole line So he's gonna handle the win reelection in california. He's already now. He's not even campaigning for reelection in california He's he's already campaigning to be president the thing that he did that was politically smart and I say this not as a fan of nuisim But this is someone who's analyzing the politics of it is that he went on true social And he basically counter your republican lies and so he's positioning himself as a fighter for progressive values and the reason why that's going to be flattering To the democratic base is that when the democrats lose big in november? They're gonna have there's gonna be a reckoning And they're gonna have to understand why they lost and the fact of the matter is that ideologues never blamed themselves or their agenda They are gonna say that it was not communicated well and that we needed a basically a better communicator who was a fighter And so they will basically pin the blame even more on the democratic base And so they will basically pin the blame even more on biden and so nuisim is positioning himself as that sort of Democratic progressive fighter if you go back remember when michael avanotti Like they were you know progressor talking about him as a presidential candidate for a brief minute.

They swooned over him Why go to jail? Yes, he's in jail right now. It's a total grifter scumbag A total grifter scumbag, but you got to remember cnn adam on there every day because he was a fighter Jacob says his name in the funniest way possible. I remember at a poker game when like helmuth said he had no numbers other jacob What's this guy's name say his name? Michael avanotti I don't know how to pronounce it. I never met these socks I'm about a bing, but a boom. I'm Michael avanotti, right? Uh, he's a disaster.

Uh, it's an interesting Concept. Yeah, it's that can you giving the dems will give nuisim the nod. Can he actually win in some of these? these middle states Well, you got to remember this is true for both parties that the general electorate does not pick the candidates the parties pick the candidates and the base of the party picks the candidates They want someone that can win pennsylvania. They want someone that can win florida. They want someone Yes and no, so if you remember When when bill clinton pulled the democratic party back to the center in 1992 and you know the whole democratic leadership council And they really remade the democratic party at that time as a more centrist party They had just come off three disastrous presidential elections So reagan in 80 and 84 and then herbert walker bush in In 88 So, you know, it took three big losses for them to rethink.

I don't think progressives are going to rethink their agenda You know based on one midterm loss even though I think it's going to be gargantuan Later this year. So I think they need more losses to really reevaluate their agenda I mean look the activists in the party are deeply invested In their agenda they're just not going to give it up. They're going to blame it on a communication problem They're going to say let's find a new messenger and nuisance will seem like a younger fresh face So I think that's how it could happen and if you look at the democratic bench Say can he also who else they got is the issue? I mean I'll be a bootage in aoc if they want to go full like crazy left would be and then if they want to go more moderate That's not that doesn't win an election.

You got to find someone that can win the election I agree, but it's gonna be about turnout governor of a big state. He which is as of now 100 billion dollar surplus looks good for him So, yeah, I mean Gavin it's a scenario. It's a scenario, but look, I think the question is will the republicans field trump after january 6th, and I I think the answer is no and It's too shameful, right to to do that. I I think that Look, I think trump's problem is you won't stop talking about the last election And I think elections are always about the future and the republicans ultimately going to nominate a candidate who represents the future No republicans want him as going out there trying to steal an election again.

No Look, if you look at straw polls, okay, if you look at straw polling Um, dissonance now is beating trump in straw polls in the republican party Jonathan chape who is a pretty smart liberal definitely not a republican, but he's a sometimes has very smart observations Remember the whole zero covet thing. Anyway, he has an article just today talking about how disantis has now eclipsed trump within the republican base and if you look at the numbers at within if you if you poll fox news viewers and likely republican primary voters Disantis is up a couple of points in the straw polls, but among fox news viewers He's up like 10 to 14 points.

So in other words, the republican base the activists who are the influencers They already have moved from trump to disantis. No, they love them. Yeah. Yeah, so I think the field the fifth disantis runs He's gonna run. He's gonna win a landslide This is why I say it's disantis versus Uh, nuisome I think but look it could be disantis versus biden. It could even be trump versus nuisome I think the configurations that win for the republicans. I think if biden's on the ticket I think any republican wins. I think if it's disantis versus nuisome. I think Disantis wins.

I think however and this is sort of the nightmare scenario. I think it's something like a nuisome versus trump I think republicans could lose that just because You know the people people people think about the future. They they they want They don't want to be reminded of the past and Um, so I think there's risk there. No more also the past is insane and deranged. You can't you can't have two year olds running for president No, that would be great. Yes. Yeah. I think all right nothing against octogenary 75 years old would be good for me All right.

This has been a this has been a very long episode. Well, yeah Well, considering how much sax is gonna spike. Uh, we'll get it back down to 45 minutes. All right, everybody's amazing I love you guys. It's really nice to be back. We're not going anywhere. Everybody relax. We're back I'm not going anywhere. You're gonna need a wrecking ball to take me out of here. You're gonna send him to the National Guard We never wanted to get rid of you jacal. We don't want to get rid of you But now all we need is three out of four votes.

So We never wanted to get rid of you jacal, but we knew we had to do certain things to get you to act right Oh my gosh jacal brought a Brought a knife to a gunfight. He came to negotiate You guys don't want any in Australia You're too cheap to give me two points. That's fine.
