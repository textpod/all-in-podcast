Model: Whisper-small

Hello everybody welcome. We are live at the all in headquarters and the all in podcast is now live We have 63 people watching already And bear with us while we get the besties on the line. I'll be doing my introductions in just a moment after I tweet this But it is an eventful night and we had to start early because It's looking like this could be another shocker and I am not Being facetious here. I am not happy about this obviously But Trump looks like he's been underestimated again. This is not a blowout We are going live early This could be a shocker folks Okay, so with me early on the pod is regular David Friedberg Uh, David, you're watching this early action And what's your early reaction to what we're seeing? um you know Trump's moved We there's nothing definitive yet, but he's moved In the results and he's moving markets We're seeing forex markets show a sharp indication That trump has a real shot at winning here treasury markets And as phil helmet will share with us betting markets as well So it is more it is more of a nail biter Then a game seven of the warriors calves So here we go There's a hell of a nail biter guys, and I'm just going to say this uh, the uk markets had at first They sw he was five to two You could you could trump at five to two two and a half to one then it hit five to four and I thought that was quite Crazy, you're watching cnn.

You're watching these networks and they're saying. Oh my god, biden's winning this No, they're not even in the right neighborhood. I'll never watch a network again an election night and now the market from five minutes ago 368 million pounds wagered 368 million pounds Trump is now a three to ten favorite Okay, so for people phil who are not gamblers if you bet three dollars a dollar she bet three dollars No, no jason you have to understand if you bet 13 dollars, okay, you don't get 13 back you only get Uh 10 back. Okay. Now if you want to bet biden it's seven to four.

So if I bet 70 dollars Uh, if I bet 40 dollars I can get 70 dollars Back on biden now the shocker is right around six 28 p.m Uh, the betting odds the markets have been in biden's favor for three straight months I've been live posting them on my twitter all day The worst I saw was uh was trump was uh was biden was minus a dollar 25 still a big favorite to win and then boom And uh, you know, there aren't people in my house that are actually crying Uh, you know, I'm very more much more in the middle of this thing But all of a sudden uh trump It all of a sudden it was five to four then it was even and then all of a sudden trump was nearly uh, a two to one favorite I'm getting live information from my friends right now Um, I'm seeing that uh That it's uh, it's a little bit lower on some of these sites.

Um, I saw 267 That's for a 200 dollar bet. So he's a pretty big favorite Um, I saw the lowest I've seen is 217 But jason if you're watching the a lot odds and I put some stuff on my twitter It's amazing how it went from you know minus a dollar 70 You know all the way down minus a 30 then it came all the way up to minus a dollar 70 This is crazy and and I've seen this movie before in 2016 actually Okay, so we all know that you need 270 electoral votes to win And that there were a couple of states that were critical Uh for trump to win And it seems like those states that trump was critical to win Um, he has now won So let's bring in david sax Uh, david we just turned on the live stream And boy is this a turn of events that I don't think any of us except for maybe you But you were very pessimistic on the last maybe three or four All in podcasts.

You're watching these results come in the betting markets have totally flipped to trump What are you seeing and what can we expect tonight? What are you looking for? Yeah, I mean it's looking just like 2016, um, I mean you're right that Um, I was looking at the polls in the last few pods that we've done And there was no way to say anything other than you know trump was the Uh was the underdog But at the same time I I still thought that Um trump had a really good shot because I was watching Both candidates on youtube all the time.

They both were doing live events. I wasn't watching it with the commentary I wasn't watching the clips. I was watching trump do these rallies. I was watching Biden do these parking lot events and I would see trump do four or five events a day flying from Um tarmac to tarmac on air force one having these huge crowds. I saw him do this event in Butler, Pennsylvania over the weekend. It looked to me like there was tens of thousands of people there Um, and I remember trump saying a line like, you know, this doesn't seem like a second place crowd and You know, it's one of those trump lines But you know, it did put in my mind this idea, you know, he's got a point Um, whatever the polls say we're seeing tens of thousands of people show up at these events Who are fanatical? I mean just fanatical For trump and so you always had to think that he had a chance to pulling off an upset just like 2016 I will say what I said on our text earlier Donald trump ate the covid virus and killed it with his body And then he stood in front of the white house and ripped his shirt off and let us all know that he is our leader He did not get elected.

He claimed victory beginning in 2016 and he has not and will not let go since then and I think it is that um cult of personality that um cult of personality draws so many people in that are just um, You know feeling like they need change and they need leadership and they don't need something from the old school and He uh, he stood up and he showed us that this whole thing is a is a fake covid is a fake Government is fake. The people are fake. The media is fake He's getting some late numbers.

I'm getting some late numbers here you guys. Um, he's now at minus a dollar 59 to win Pennsylvania and they took every other number off the board However, if you're a bidenperson jason Uh, the number is only 2.17 right now. Um, so Oh wow the polls are posters were miles off on this And this is just amazing And it seems like from what we're hearing from the reporting is that the pollsters did not understand Uh, the latin or I guess latin x is a way to describe Um a group of people who actually don't think exactly the same.

I've always had a weird um understanding of this term latin x which seems to come from the woke left But cubans Puerto Ricans Mexicans these are different countries. They're not all the same as wailans Venezuelans. See this is not a monoculture Just because they all speak the same language and we're seeing something very different happen in florida right now. We're male Uh, cubans maybe are voting very differently than what pollsters expected Uh, bestie chumath is now fresh off a tight haircut and he's here on the pod. Hear me We've got bestie phyllis our first bestie guesty of the night Bestie p.

How are you bestie p? Chumath you and I we shouldn't talk about this This is about politics, but you and I were just filming high stakes poker in los vegas on friday night It was great to see you bestie Is there any indication you can give us besides? I mean, of course, there's a presidential election that is going to determine the future of humanity But more importantly, how did you each do in the high stakes poker game? the biggest the biggest the biggest part of the night was around 400k maybe 500k played between me and dur Did dur Yeah, anyone He did not win the hand.

Oh my lord Chumath won that one go chumath go And it was I think it was beautifully beautifully played. I think Doug poke will definitely do a short video clip on it. Uh, I did a I did a very, uh, very sneaky three bet preflop turn check um River overbluff and got him to call Oh my lord A little set bomb i'm guessing but here we go, uh Jason. I can't wait Uh, since i'm here to promote promote promote everything I promote, uh, you can only watch these episodes of high stakes poker a lot of Players favorite show you can only watch them on the poker go app.

They're coming out december 16th meet chumath phil ivy tom dwan Ben lamb a lot of your a lot of your heroes take it away. Oh, well can't wait can't wait to uh And I have a subscription to that all in. Um, I'm sorry the poker go app. It's it's well worth it David sacks you have one of your Um, recording friends on the pod. Why don't you introduce? Uh, one of your consulting friends and and uh, we'll have him tee up What we think the possible scenarios are and where we're at right now at this very moment It is 657 in california.

Yeah, so michael newman works for me as a researcher and um he's uh Is a political scientist like he gets you could say and I've known him since college and he's very uh steeped in these Uh, a lot of these races. I don't know if he's yeah, I have been obsessively following politics since uh the reagan election of 1980 so I was a delight then so No, I'm afraid I'm uh, I was only 10 but I was already Uh, a political obsessive and as you can imagine a real hit with the ladies as well so Tell us what What are the key states we need to focus in on here and which one of them? Uh, have enough reporting for us to sort of put them in a column and then move on and understand the path to victory for trump or biden yes, well, I mean, uh Depending upon which uh network or news organization you're following They are either calling calling a lot of states or they're being very conservative about their calls I mean nbc has still not called florida for trump, but there's really no path for biden to win that state Uh, so you can put that safely in the trump column He has just taken the lead in north carolina after trailing all night We've got about 88 of the vote in now and I suspect he's home free as is the republican incumbent senator there Well, can I can I can I just can I just ask a question? I mean, isn't it typically the case that the Counts from the most populous urban areas come last And those tend to skew more democrat than republicans that sometimes happens.

Uh, it depends on the state Uh, some states have their rural areas come in last One of the things that has changed the vote in north carolina is as the early vote came in as the uh In person early vote and mail in ballots came in the last counties that reported that early vote were the rural counties That's why early on it looked very good for biden and now it looks Like uh, it's trending away from him. Well, wait a second. Yeah north carolina according to the new york times and according to Uh, cnn right now is favoring slightly biden 49.7

to 49.1 for trump with 84 I don't think that's I don't think that's quite current. I think they're up to about 88 But again, yeah, it's it's very close. What's interesting is Uh, biden had five potential states where he could have knocked trump out florida, georgia, north carolina, ohio and texas We don't know the table. We don't yeah florida's off the table The others are still on the table, but none of them are trending biden's direction at the present time so he uh, yeah, so far trump is uh Is staying in the hand as uh, as you poker players would would say he's uh, he's Uh, he's getting the cards he needs to stay in the to stay in the game But we still have the river to play and the river would be in this case michigan wisconsin pennsylvania texas Had an early lead for biden, which was crazy to see Right now.

It's got donald trump at 50.3 percent biden at 48.3 percent guys again. So that's starting to normalize I I I go back to this one very critical thing The reason why michigan wisconsin pennsylvania right now are trump is because you count the When the county is counted you can pass the votes and you can report and if you have 25,000 people in a county versus Allegheny county, which has like I don't know hundreds of thousands or a million plus people. It just takes longer Yes, no, I listen. I don't characterize michigan wisconsin pennsylvania at all I think one of the reasons why michigan right now looks so red is because They're counting today's vote first a lot of these other states that like florida that had the Option because their legislature allows them to do this.

They counted all that early vote in advance And they dumped it in one big pile Uh, as soon as the polls closed in the in the various counties So that's why you saw early on a blue mirage there What you're seeing in a place like michigan right now is probably a red mirage Because it's it's today's vote which was going to skew trump Uh, because of the because of the way he presented it to his people. He florida was the one state thank goodness for his sake that he Encouraged people to vote early and by mail in the other states.

He encourages people to vote today So here's a here's a stat in pennsylvania. I'm on the um secretary of states reporting dashboard They've counted only 12 percent of the mail in ballots Um, which is and the total mail in ballots is 2.5 million. Yeah, um, which is huge, right? And they've only it should be a majority of the vote. I would imagine, you know, yeah Yeah, and they've and they've only counted 24 percent actually, sorry they've only Yeah, they've only counted a handful of precincts at this point A quarter of the precincts, right? So here's something I don't understand.

So, uh, nick, uh, Carlson from uh, was it like business insider? He just tweeted um minutes ago That north carolina biden is ahead with 99 of the vote counted and biden has a less than 0.2 lead, but it's 9 000 votes. But I mean that's That would be a huge problem for trump Networks are Carolina. I listen. I think a loss in any of those five states florida georgia, north carolina, ohio or texas Is probably by the way guys. I just want to give a shout out to nothing who's listening here all the way from srelanka He's listening.

He just texted me. Okay, just want by the way guys Right now the odds are three to one on the betting market. So I mean obviously the networks I realized are completely useless I stopped watching him a long time ago when they had biden way ahead in florida And the odds were 10 to 1 against right now if you wanted bet trump is a three to one favorite On and there's been billions of dollars bet in england australia all over the world He's a three to one favorite. It looks like it's real to me And just uh, and just to just to build your side of the case Uh nasdaq futures ripping s and p futures falling and the 10 and 30 year falling remin b ripping These are all pro trump trades and the euro the euro collapse the euro dollar falling Falling sharply once the markets turn towards trump.

Well, here's what the reacting to is wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania trump is all up big time Now again, this this that lacks a very basic understanding of how county reporting is happening in these highly populous you know or these sort of sorry these these uh bimotally distributed states where they have a bunch of suburban and rural vote that's fast account and The big places for example, like, you know, you're not going to see milwaukey and green bay report until probably close to midnight So you have another two hours. So the question is why why are the betting markets so pro trump then? What do they know that we don't know? I will say this let me say this jason I mean if you're like they're you're talking about billions of dollars, right? And so all you had to do is design a system To figure out how to calculate votes earlier and make a couple hundred million dollars.

Okay. These are the smartest people in the world There's hundreds of millions of dollars billions of dollars at stake They obviously do it 10 times better than any other site than in the other network So this information, I mean, I give a friend of mine posted. Hey, I'm laying two to one on uh on twitter Guys, I'm buying my other friend bet four hundred thousand dollars to eight hundred thousand dollars trump and now he looks like a genius Somebody knows something that we don't know Well, trump just on bovada trump just moved to minus 600 Yeah, just took michigan on Unbelievable minus it looks like he's uh, it looks like he's ahead in michigan But again, we have to see detroit and there's there's a bunch of places in michigan.

Let's Let's let's let's bathe the north. So here's the north carolina secretary estate dashboard And they're showing uh, two thirds of the counties and you can actually see by county when you go onto their their dashboard the um You know jamaat the larger counties are partially reported most of the smaller counties are fully reported um 63 total with um, you know, biden ahead by literally a thousand votes right now across 2.5 22 million to 2.5 21 million. Wow But what percent reported is that I mean it's 63 percent of the counties have completely reported And so the remaining counties if you look at the reporting status the remaining counties that are partially reported There's a mix of rural and some of the urban counties, you know, Durham's in there partially reported Uh, so there is a mix.

It's not Durham should be a biden county. The research triangle is uh, scale well educated professionals That I think are the the backbone of the democrats Uh coalition in a state like north carolina Now they have um absentee votes that are counted And they have so far counted 3.3 million absentee one stop votes And a million votes by mail, but that's how many came in it actually shows that only Five oh, I see. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Trump is now ahead in ohio By two thirds of the votes were absolutely post the link into the zoom chat so nick and pull it up on the screen, please um I need to get an understanding of something very basic here for the audience who's not to generate gamblers Are is there a chance here phil and chamath gambling experts both? That people had put early money on biden And are now covering or hedging some of those bets.

Is that a possibility here? Yes Okay, jason jason the line is minus a dollar minus four ten on pinnacle right now Let me just double check that source. So what what phil is saying jason is like. Yes, there's going to be a bunch of Essentially covering now that covering will swing the line But I think what phil is also saying is when a line moves this violently literally what we've seen in the last 35 minutes Is both the equity markets the currency markets and the betting markets flip 180 degrees from where they have been not just all day But frankly where they had been probably for the last few months That's what I was saying chamath for three months straight Uh right now biden has been a favorite anywhere between three to one favorite at one point All the way to maybe you know 50 favorite and all of a sudden today The lowest I saw was a dollar 35 and I was kind of shocked and the next thing, you know Boom trumps a three to four to one favorite So and and I'm looking at cnn and I'm looking at these networks and they're still they still have biden ahead and I'm like Wow, what is going on? They're way behind That's that's the next thing we need to take care of chamath.

There's a business for you is Somehow we can deliver the right data on elections quickly. There you go sax Yeah, well, I think the betting markets know something we don't know because Um, Trump is just you know, if you look at like the live stream on twitter or the new york times or something trump just slightly took the lead in Ohio, but that's the state he's supposed to win in north carolina. It looks like with over 99 percent reporting It looks like he lost by 9 000 votes by the way a 9 000 vote margin would probably trigger an automatic recount of north carolina And there's like 100 000 absentee ballots there.

I don't know if those have been counted yet Okay, so we're gonna put let's put let's pause for a second on this everybody north carolina is one of the four or five states trump has to win In order to have a victory right michael. I absolutely agree with that He had to have those five florida north carolina georgia, ohio in texas. Okay, so we have florida He's got now there's four left. There's four left. George is a very slow counting state We really don't know all of itlanta could be out for all we know So we leave georgia on the side.

So now we got four states we can work with north carolina Is in biden's pocket by just a hair Yeah, that could change and it would trigger a recount which would take days to weeks Yes, the other three states. Let's go through them systematically one by one michael. Okay, uh, ohio uh, was the biggest surprise of the night when biden built an early lead there although again A bit of a blue mirage based upon Uh, the fact that the mail in vote and the early vote came in so strong for the democrats this year Uh, because they emphasized it and the republicans kind of fought against it Uh, but michael michael with 49 of the vote in ohio, okay He had a right now biden had a massive lead and yet about a 400 000 vote lead would have to correct And when you look at the betting odds, he was five to one underdog to win the state So something doesn't add up there and you can you can say all right some of that is all the early voting went for biden We know that to be a fact, but there's something else there Okay, i'm just looking at the Uh results for ohio will stay on ohio for one more moment And then we have another guest who just jumped on ohio Is currently showing donald trump with two point Rounding it up 2.4

million votes to 2.2 million slightly rounding up for joe biden 52 to 47 percent with 78 percent reporting. Does that mean we feel comfortable with trump winning Ohio and less all of cleveland is outstanding. I would say that's a trump state, you know Okay, we now have john cohen on the line john is a Member of the survey monkey team john welcome to the all in pod. Can you hear us? Thank you so much I'm sorry. I didn't hear what was going on. I don't I don't know how much you've been disparaging polster so far So we know we're waiting for you.

We're waiting to get here Tell us as we start what your prediction was earlier today Well, we're very clear to say that we're doing measurements not predictions That said the measurements that we are doing clearly point into biden advantages across the board But we didn't have we so far. We have no surprises, you know, we had florida Had been trump plus two basically all week going to dead even Um, you know coming into election day itself. We don't know where the final votes will be Most analysts think that it's in trump's camp. It may end up there, but it's super close We had georgia close.

We had north carolina close Although a north glenn had been closing it had been a big biden lead. It was down to under two points With the senate, you know kind of even closer than that in some of our data So, you know kind of so far. There's no obvious surprise here like damn the polls were really wrong certainly ours You know, it's our it's early though. We're not declaring victory on those obviously There's a lot to watch but nothing really to surprise You know us giving the numbers so far What about ohio and georgia? So we had ohio pretty consistently in trump's camp.

We had them up four So it's trending that way now. We had it as close as two points for trump I mean again, I haven't mentioned the word margin of error. That's in my professional Obligation and duty to mention it. It's around three points. I believe two and a half in ohio So close, but we always had it in trump's camp again Biden that wasn't part of biden's, you know any of the past and victory that they campaign was counting on so You know no big deal, but we went from having a early night to now.

We're sure for sure and for a really late night here John, let me ask you that one of the most basic questions that I've had which is What did we learn from 2016 and tell me what exactly did people try to fix like what was the thing that? everybody got wrong And what changed well the biggest thing that polls fixed was how they adjust their polls by education Well, we see in polling no matter how they're conducted whether online as we do a survey monkey Or still on the telephone which most media pollsters do is you get people who with more formal education To answer those surveys in far greater proportions than you do people with lower education So the biggest thing you got to do and look we always did it so we weren't in the among the state pollsters who kind of failed I think You know kind of negligently to adjust by education at all We always adjust by education, but we what we failed to notice in 2016 was there was an increasing gap between those with Postgraduate degrees and those of BA's they've always been both to pro democratic group, but the gap in 2016 was abnormally large A fix to our polls which I just point out weren't you know kind of we're actually Standouts in the in the upper midwest in terms of showing it as a close race not clear of clean victories We broke apart post grads and grads into two distinct categories and that released kind of about a point and a half of unforced error In our polling from 2016.

So that's fixed. We've used it to good effect again this time around We weren't showing what all the other national polls are showing We've had this between a four and six point national leap again We'll get quickly into why national results don't matter, but you all know that all too well Everyone knows that all too well, but we've had it kind of more narrow and that plays out in the states that I mentioned We had florida tide not a four point biden five point biden Advantage elsewhere, you know, but we'll see how it plays out in the Midwest.

We also had Wisconsin What was our final margin there? I think it was you know kind of nine and nine and a half points Not the 17 points that you saw from my former colleagues at the Washington Post and ABC news So we've always had it a little bit tighter But again it plays how it's going to play out in these states and so far no surprises But the night is early and I have a healthy dose of pulsars paranoia Jamal if I don't have to answer your question well enough, but that was the main thing people did It's really helpful.

But now take off your pollster measure, you know chief research officer hat for a second and put on just the American hat um What does it mean? When you know, we had effectively a repudiation of the establishment in 2016 And despite everything that's happened over the last four years We may be on the brink of another repudiation again if you You know where you're there to measure the pulse of what's going on But less in sort of measurement speak and just more in just plain American English speak john What like what's going on if this happens again? See you're absolutely right.

There's something major. I would also like to caveat it We are looking once again at if trump wins. It's because of the electoral college Like he is going to lose the popular vote. They're still far more American and American voters who voted today and you know Kind of over the past several weeks who would prefer Joe Biden to be president So again, we can't characterize with a broad brush the American voting population When this is about you effectively I hate to call it a quirk But this is about our system of vote tallying and the president, you know to pull back your point about kind of There is something major here the fact that many people, you know Some of us might be friends with can't understand why this isn't a hundred to zero race Fail to understand that the president's base isn't Small it is, you know, we've had it 44 to 46 percent approving of his job performance for Many years now like he has a completely durable solid floor.

He also has a high ceiling Right, so he was never going to win the popular vote this time around But he had a chance at that electoral, you know squeaking out another electoral college win because he's been so stable You know, this is a president who you know kind of up Trump now head and NC. Thank you for the chat window So I think you're right that we need to understand more about what is the Componentry of that 45 percent that they would support Trump when the other 55 percent are so dead set against him And see it as something really wrong with the country.

So we still I mean, oh good. No, I'm what have you guys done to though understand the people that are voting for Trump better because I think that they are protesting And they're protesting a lot And I think that you know, if we didn't listen to them in 16, I think it's almost criminal to not listen to them in 2020 So what are they? What are they saying? What are they rejecting or what is it that they want because at the end of the day? You know, I think his incompetence can't really be debated competence versus incompetence I think what we can debate is he's a vessel and in that I think that it's incredibly important What's happening irrespective of what happens today because we were supposed to walk into a landslide.

We're not as you said We're going to be in a nail biter What is what are what are they using him as a vessel to communicate to everybody else? That's a really good question. I mean some of that will depend on you know a closer analysis of the surveys ours where we talked to more than a million voters and the exit polls They're being conducted by two separate organizations today But what's the one of the storylines that come out of the election? You know one of the things that's being reported early is there's a much tighter Hispanic vote in Florida than many early polls You know predicted how will that play out as we start to get votes, you know coming out in texas? How is it being Arizona say Arizona looking positively for Biden and mark kelly in the senate, you know in Arizona You know kind of is it is it really Hispanic votes that are driving some trump strength in these states? Or you kind of is it the obsession that the muse media has had for the past four years around the kind of Trump middle aged white male voter with less than college education who has been displaced by You know technological and industrial trends over the past 20 years I think it's going to depend on what that voting coalition looks like for trump and it's more diverse than I think we've been focusing on for Four years, I think you're saying an incredibly important thing.

I think that that was a ruse and I've always thought that that was bullshit It's not some undereducated rubes that's running around voting for this guy um, I think that there are there are people up and down the The age spectrum the socioeconomic spectrum And this is what I mean by he has become a vessel for so many different messages And I think we really have to start figuring out what the hell these messages actually mean because um, if biden loses to your point maybe in florida, it's a repudiation of socialism Okay, but in pennsylvania, it's going to be something else in michigan.

It's going to be something else in ohio It's going to be something else for him to keep winning right? um, and and I just don't think that there's a consistent idea and it's very dismissive to say that I'm not saying you are but I'm saying, you know that idea that it was Um an out of work x factory worker, you know in rural ohio that was protesting This is going to be much bigger than that because even if biden wins the popular vote until we figure out how to rebounce balance the electoral college in a completely, you know New way or just get rid of it all together um, we're going to have to live with Understanding how some folks in these extremely pivotal states Um are pushing back are they pushing back on political correctness? You know, that's one thing that I've always thought I think that there's a huge vote here against um Cancel culture cancel culture All of that stuff absolutely And and lockdowns.

I think those are the under reported Lockdowns are the I think the biggest one of the biggest drivers or no go ahead john go ahead No, I was going to say one of the components here that we have to pay a lot of attention to is gender Right kind of you have the storyline for a long time I mean you think about you know, kind of republican democratic politics is that you know We talk about black voters and hispanic voters talking about them as if they're monoliths What we have seen consistently over the course of the year is that trump does Much better among black men and hispanic men than he does among black women and latinas and that is just kind of like You know whereas black women are 95 5 you know he nears 20 percent among black men It blends into that what we've been 90 10th here.

You see look, but I look these these are measurements These are measurements. I don't think they're telling you the whys of anything and Um, I think for the whys you have to go a lot deeper. I mean first of all, let's let's talk about the lockdown issue Can we just pull up that? Tweet nick. I mean so this is what I said back in may this was like months ago before the election even hit You know, which is if the woke left insists on permanent lockdowns Trump will have an issue that supersedes The incompetence of coveted response because I think you know, we all we all agree on that Which is whether our lives and livelihoods belong to politicians to meet her out In dribs and drab is they see fit and this was back when elan was being shut out of his factory in freemont And then there was this hairdresser named shillie luther in texas who was basically um put on trial for opening up her hair salon and the the judge wanted her to Grovel and beg for forgiveness And this was the beginning of the rebellion over lockdowns and it was so obvious back then That lockdowns weren't going to fly.

They weren't sustainable. They were too politically unpopular Um, they weren't gonna work and and by the way if it was something A cause that the left agreed with like, you know, a blm rally or something like that then you were allowed to do it You know, it was that whole standard around You know doing things that were essential And so, you know this insistence on lockdowns even after the public had really Repudiated them. I think was a major issue for for trump And it was crazy to me that biden was still insisting on lockdowns, you know Still, I mean that is his official position Um, I don't think it's the only reason why he's in trouble right now, but I think it's a big one I think if he if trump reaches the blue wall again of michigan, wisconsin and pennsylvania Lockdowns is the biggest reason why because those are three states that had extensive and still have Uh extensive lockdowns.

It hurts people. I'll here. I'll read you a tweet And I won't name who it's from it's from a farmer In um in the corn belt who's well followed on twitter. Believe it or not, there's a whole Ag twitter community and he says well, it's the day does this country turn down the road to be like venezuela? Or do we continue on the road of capitalism? And um, he's had this acute um feeling that he's kind of Uh vocalized on twitter for for months now on how painful the lock lock downs have been on him and his family and his business and on the community And uh, it just feels like overreach to a lot of people that the recognition that um, You know, the left might be using to justify the decision is just not there that the the impact the near term impact that folks are feeling Is what's there and that's driving a lot of behavior right now boys all markets are now up Everything is green dow futures smp 500 futures nested futures Oil is up gold is down and there were some guys that made some heavy bets against the dollar going into this thinking we were going to have massive inflation with biden policy coming up and um, some big fund managers That went really big on on shorting the dollar this last week.

Um, and the dollar's up right now Yeah, the dollar by the way We should we should make sure at some point tonight to talk about these very important senate races because it's not just Trump versus biden that there's also a bunch of John hick and louber hick and louber one in colorado Hick and louber one in colorado But there've been some you know, some of the republicans who look to be in big trouble like lindsay graham have uh, have pulled it out and have won and um, So it's looking like the senate is still very much in play.

I would say as big a favorite as biden was the senate Shifting from republican to democrat. Well, I'd say that was considered as equally big a favorite And that that may not happen now So we should make sure to talk about that at some point north carolina right now is 49.8 percent to 49 percent for biden 2.6 million versus 2.58 Ohio is at 2.4 to 2.2 51 52 percent to 47 percent trump is beating biden. I um, I have a question for john cohen john um, let's go back to Um, sort of your understanding as you've been measuring different trends.

Have you measured People's sympathy towards lockdowns on a state by state level and then second question is have you measured people's? sympathy to cancel culture at a state by state level and by the way, you're on mute. So if you want to just take yourself off Yeah, thank you. We have not done anything on cancel culture. We've done a lot on the coronavirus We've been tracking that actually in three countries since mid february And we have a state by state look and what's interesting is we ask the question like is this primarily an economic issue or a primary health issue and those two have been running neck and neck But the health you kind of more people on average say it's a health issue than an economic one Trump with trump supporters overwhelmingly say that crisis is one that's financial not health related So there's always been that but it's been like a 45 55 gap there So if we've been measuring it state by state, but there's a solid core of people and it gets to davis point about why What are they focused on? What is the what is affecting them and their you know pocketbooks? it is the you know in lockdowns and the kind of clamping down and what is this Economic crisis not a healthcare one even though that's what we all say that they should follow There was a there is a there was a fantastic line that the democrats coined which essentially said something to the tune sacksy Poo you'll tell me if I get this wrong, but it was socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the for the rest of us is essentially sort of their grab bag phrase for for this election cycle and Sort of to frame a lot of policies, but when you have in these states again, if we say this cuts along socioeconomic lines but then maybe bleeds into college and even you know graduate level educated folks Is there a vote here for um rugged individualism and just leave me the fuck alone There certainly could be I want to go back to what david said about measuring versus the why because I mentioned gender to point out a Big difference that we're seeing across racial groups across levels of education But I'm you know, we're we're polling every day.

So you guys have the right why question You know send it to me. You know send to xander. We'll we'll ask it You know, we pulled 9 000 people today on you know kind of their willingness to accept the results And so we'll be putting that out, you know tomorrow We have a we'll have an exit poll running every day from here on to certainly till we get a result So you have the question you want to ask send along. We'll get you the data at the state level. All right, john We very much appreciate you coming on the pod and we will be checking survey monkeys amazing data as we go Um, I'm going to switch now and just john john john.

Thank you and xander. Thanks for doing for hooking that up Thanks, john. Thanks guys. Thank you and we'll have some more bestie. Gasti's coming up some fan favorites from the twitter and the poker group I just want to point out right now that it's very interesting to see that fox has biden at 129 electoral votes and trump at 109 and Some of the other networks have it much lower. How do the networks make these decisions? of when to call A state because it's too early according to many to call florida, but we're sitting here with a pretty clear Understanding of where florida's at Does anybody have any thoughts on that of well? I think they're airing on the side of extreme caution because of the strange year that it is and the fact that there is all this We had a hundred over a hundred million votes banked early through the mail or through early in person voting and Nobody sure how many more mail ballots they're according to one side I looked at there were still 27 million ballots outstanding now some of those are redundant ballots like uh david's father in law who got three ballots in the mail In pennsylvania And a lot of those are probably going in the trash, but there could be another five to ten million of those to come in That are postmarked by today many states will accept them after the election as long as they're postmarked by election day So they're probably being very very careful That they don't make a premature call.

Of course, they all have PTSD about what happened in 2000 When they first prematurely called florida for al gore Then prematurely called it for george w. Bush and we spent the next 37 days trying to figure out what the hell happened in florida so I think they're going to air on the side of extreme caution across the board Although, uh, I feel like the margin in florida at this point is Insurmountable insurmountable now right that florida florida's over florida's over. It's about now It's about her on its about ohio by the way the betting markets have just moved again big time So doll trump was at minus 600 now.

He's minus 250 on bovado phil. What do you think about that? Yeah snapping back. I will say let me let me address what jayson was talking about a few seconds ago and that's it You know basically florida even the new york times had them um at at 6 p.m. At 95 percent To go to trump at 95 percent that was a new york timeside my wife and I looked it up And the betting odds had them at over 10 to 1. This was at 5 30. This was two hours ago So, I mean, I just think there's a huge inefficiency with with the way the i think it was over as soon as the miami day dump Showed that biden only won the early vote by nine points.

I mean the hillary won by 29 in 2016 and she lost the state so How much of this do we think has to do with tax policy? People in florida are retiring We have the aoc gang. We have elizabeth warren Come on jayson trump moved to florida. It's his beloved state he has a place that he's Okay, so hometown favorite moro lago. I get that but you have so many retirees and We we have this bifurcation of how taxes should work in the united states So I just want to open that up for the entire group to discuss Of art.

Are we seeing old people? Are we seeing people who are concerned about taxes? Because we have had a flight In the last couple of years of people from high tax states to low tax states. Is this about taxes? Do you think? Let's start with you freedberg. No one wants to pay taxes the fuck I'm like no one's gonna raise their hand I mean there's a moment where taxes don't matter if well, but romney Romney was in favor of taxes and he you know, he didn't win Any any of these elections like the way that the trump looks like he's going to I think that The the traditional republican messages message of taxes is sort of necessary but not sufficient um, trump obviously brought a whole set of issues that previous republicans hadn't Um, hadn't brought and I think that You I think you have to look at 2016 separately from 2020 and so starting with 2016 I think the big issue that trump that no republican really had ever figured out except maybe Papua can in 20 years ago was the trade issue with china, you know, we forget that In the 1970s When the great chinese economic reformer dung xiaoping decided to open up the chinese economy the average chinese was making $2 a day And today their economy is is roughly the size of the us now You know, what was the reason for that? Well, we had a bipartisan consensus in this country for 30 or 40 years on the part of both Clintons and both bushes that we should you know open them We should welcome them with open arms and we opened up our market to chinese products.

We brought them into the world trade organization And I'm a fan but but but that was the start that was the start of that was the the killer app or the killer issue That trump figured out and that's what shattered the blue firewall in those rust belt states I mean if you're going to try and figure out going back 2016 why trump won you have to explain why he won michigan was you're saying our jobs they took our jobs But what I'm saying is the manufacturing jobs went out and the fentanyl came in. I mean, that's his argument And um, that was a killer argument.

I mean and the proof is in the pudding It's the proof is that he won these states that hillary thought were so in the bag that she didn't even bother to campaign there Uh, that was the big surprise At 2020 and the issue of taxes because no, no, no, no, no, let me explain what's going on in 2020 in my opinion Okay, this is not a partisan explanation, but I think that after the loss in 2016 look In business we know that when you lose when you make a mistake You make a bad investment or the company does something wrong You analyze what you did wrong, right? And then you figure out what changes to make the democrat party did not do that What do they do? They blame facebook.

They blame it on russian interference They never really analyze why they lost these rust belt states and made Changes instead what they began was this hysterical denunciation of trump you had this sort of you sort of had this this sort of You know media culture uh tech industrial complex who decided that trump was a an illegitimate president and You know and so what they did is they went all in on impeachment They went all in on this russia stuff and in the process they created this enormous backlash And I think that 2020 if 2016 was an economic repudiation of the elites 2020 is a cultural repudiation of the elites.

That is the big issue in 2020. Yeah, I uh, I tend to I tend to I'm sympathetic to david's view. I don't completely agree with all of it, but um Just to build on something you said, I don't think jason this has anything to do with taxes Um, I think that in florida The if we if we end up really getting to the bottom of what happened I think there's a lot of people Older people that probably lived through some version of macartheism and immigrants who actually fled really shitty totalitarian countries who were like You want to do what? here um, and I think that there was a lot of people that basically Are giving a very clear signal which is I am a democrat But if you push me to the brink and talk about a socialized nanny state, I'm going to vote republican So today of its point.

I totally agree to today of its point if there was an economic repudiation of sort of traditional globalism in 2016 And donald trump ends up carrying the day in today then it's a repudiation of sort of these cultural manifestos and norms that We're swinging to now The the answer to that may be to say change the electoral college because it doesn't represent the majority or the plurality of americans I hear that But in the same way that you know, we've said for years now that the republicans will have to change to win the electoral college or to change to win What's evolving in terms of? um people's perceptions on social policy Uh, it may actually be the democrats that also have to change if this doesn't swing hard back in biden's favor so and Chumath when you when you make that statement I think what's particularly prescient is the democrats believed that because of the demographic shift from white americans To people of color latinos black americans that they were just going to win all of them This is this is the problem that if you were this is the problem with the stupidity of the establishment Like if you take a thousand brown people and put us in a room What I will tell you is just in case here's a fucking memo for all you white people out there.

We're not all the goddamn same Okay, and if you put a thousand black people here's the memo now for the democrats and the republicans They're not all the same you can take a thousand hispanics and it turns out they're not all the same So maybe you know, you can take a thousand straight people a thousand gay people They're we're not all the fucking same So maybe what this means is that we've moved past color and now ideology and social policy and economic and monetary and fiscal All of these things that the totality of how a rational well developed person Makes a decision maybe that's at hand and before if we historically only thought you know older white men and white women could do it Maybe now it actually applies independent of color and gender Yeah, I absolutely agree with that and I would add to that that uh, if if trump's victory in 2016 laid waste to the republican establishment if he wins again tonight it will lay waste to the democratic establishment and the theory of the case that they've had for 20 years the sort of uh share a emerging democratic majority case that They just had to sit back and let demography become destiny and they could just uh graft an identity politics onto the same Neoliberal economic agenda they've been pushing since the late 1980s and it would all just somehow magically produce Uh majority results in the country.

They are going to have to go back to the drawing board And and I think get more populist themselves And come up with some kind of version of politics that is Isn't it more in the burning mold? It needs to be left but not woke isn't it going to be socialism? It's it probably is going to be socialism, but it's I mean that's like if you if you lay waste to the center You know your left like I mean that's basically what happened I've been a the republicans and now if you're saying the same is going to happen with the democrats this time around you're going to have a Oc running for president in four years And I mean she won't be the right brand though because she's woke you guys.

There's you need to share it brown You don't need aOC We need a charismatic democratic candidate Somehow charred brown keeps getting elected in in increasingly red, ohio as an old school gravelly voiced irish labor democrat And somehow bernie ignited a movement as a very old school Uh gravelly voiced uh jewish democrat Uh, neither of whom gave a dam about identity politics really they were principally concerned with inequality and uh Income redistribution. I uh, I want to I want to see that happen But I think that's the only path forward for the dam. Hold on Let's let me go to phil because phil had so many ones to add there and then we'll go to you too much Yeah, I want to say that we needed for the democrats and uh, they just needed that I think they needed a very they needed a charismatic powerful leader with a lot of charisma I mean, I know that you know the I was hanging out with one of the trump guys It was with him on the plane in the 2016 election.

He said that you know, he outworked illyri There's no doubt that he outworked biden. I mean this guy's going to seven rallies a day Um showing up with a ton of energy and he has you know, like him or not. He has a lot of charisma Also, I can't help but think that you're talking about repeat repeat Repudiating sorry. I'm getting that word wrong Um to me, this is all about I think a lot of people are really scared of socialism Okay, and I think it's just like even the young people that you know, even the young people You know who say that they love it.

They're looking at their path to the future and and with and you know, they can they can Still do great things. There's no doubt. You can still be a 20 year old and and make a billion dollars by the time you're 30 or 40 And I think with socialism that goes away I think that um Look, I uh, I think If trump does win Um, I don't think what it means is that you need a a person that's At the extreme left to win. I actually counterintuitive. We would say the odd the opposite Which is that you need just a more credible centered Person now that may only be possible if the democratic party cleaves in two And the reality is the republicans may actually quasi cleave in two independent of whether trump wins or not anyways Um, and we'll see as david said how some of these senate seats break because if that goes in a different direction You know, for example, if trump wins, but we have, you know, a democratic tie In the senate, maybe that's not possible Um, but um, I think that would say a lot around um the need for Um the need for pragmatic but more youthful leadership Okay, I want to go around the horn right now.

What is your gut telling me? Who is going to win given what we know right now? Everybody give it a thought uh when you're ready looking to the camera and I will call on you michael You're looking into the camera Who's gonna win if you had to pick one right now michael give us your best guess with the Uh, can you spot me the winner of the recount in north carolina because that would tell me a lot but uh, Uh, I have increasingly think trump is going to win Okay, phil you're looking in the camera.

Who do you think's gonna win? We've seen this movie before Um, except that hillary was actually five to one favorite last time and I watched these numbers go straight up And now i'm watching the same thing. It seems like although I will say this You know sacks has been posting some stuff within our channel about the numbers popping up and down I'm getting texts and they are popping up and up. It's still the lowest I've seen is 2.5 to 1. I think trump wins Trump wins Who do you got sacks? Well, I'm gonna assume the betting markets know something.

Um, I'm still A little bit unclear on on north carolina because I saw some tweets that biden had wanted by a few thousand votes, but the um, the the north carolina website is showing Um, that actually trump's ahead about like 70 000 votes. So I'm not sure who to believe. Um And uh, well, yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna go I'm gonna I'm gonna go with what the bad markets are saying, which is trump and You know, I thought that He I thought he had a much better shot than the polls were reflecting and that's what it's looking like What do you got freberg? Donald trump took on corona virus for us.

He killed it He is our true leader and he will prevail Here in the united states of america tonight At least the betting markets are telling me and the treasury markets and the s&p futures are telling me Donald Trump's going away, but I do think that the fact that this guy has never conceded defeat to anything in his life Gives him a huge leg up and he uh, you know, he is he is like steve jobs He warps reality and he tells everyone I am going to win. I have killed corona virus and It happens Wait like a jedi night.

It's a jedi. Yeah, all right. I will for a four so far picking trump at Uh, exactly 7 45 p.m. California time. Tramath. Who do you have at this point if you had to shove your chips all in? I still think the path is um um I I think it's biden and I have the advantage of some information which is that uh, they just announced breaking news They aren't counting mail in votes in philadelphia tonight And I am going with so so we don't know Uh, pennsylvania tonight. So if it's down to a few thousand votes philly, I think is going to break I think you can count that as three or four 100 000 votes Yeah, and if it should be it should be 500 000.

It should be 500 000. Well, then 500 000 would carry the state for joe biden Yeah, they've they've counted so 100 000 so they've got so i'm gonna i'm gonna stick with biden here because I think that uh That philadelphia vote count is uh crucial. It turns out that it may it may come down to philly Which by the way, okay, what an incredibly poignant place for the election to be won and lost The city of underdogs the city of rocky I think we can safely say that biden is going to win the popular vote and it might be by four points five points which means that there is a discrepancy Uh between the popular vote and electoral college.

We're going to hear a lot about that because uh, I I'm going to go with biden because My heart is going to be so broken If this country picks this sociopath to run it for another four years after his absolute failure to content to do even the most modest things to battle coronavirus and the strife he has caused between americans and his personal style is so heartbreaking to me that I don't know that I can believe in america if they put this absolutely sociopathic person Who has the least amount of character of any other human being? Anybody on this call has ever met in their lives.

It would be a complete Absolute utter disgrace if he makes it into office for a second term Jason, what do you really exist? So you're going to respond to that? Well, look, I mean the american people. Hold on. It's an existential threat. It's still going to be a bigger planet and humanity and democracy across the world If this country puts that maniac into office again for four goddamn fucking more years I'll make a prediction that's my personal feeling I can't I don't care what the statistics stay right now in my heart I cannot give that man Even a benefit of the doubt if he wins garbage if he wins is fauci the first guy fired Oh, I think you can count on it and Fauci and Christopher Ray the FBI director and on right and Bill Bahr to Shred of credibility or honor is gone.

I want to I want to just say to to J. Cal I really empathize with how you're feeling because I have never as a person that has been a citizen of three countries When I moved to America in 2000, I have never really I mean, you know edge cases. Yeah, I felt some racism here, obviously You know, I've but I've never felt so unwanted and I remember 2016 For the first time in my life feeling a level of insecurity. I had never felt before because I was so afraid I didn't know what it meant for Donald Trump to be elected four years later You know in in so many ways It's like two realms of a coin, you know, I leave my house and You can just see that there's just so much pain and divisiveness I come back into my little world and things seem to be really great and That's a really really terrible feeling to have Jason.

So I I know exactly what you're talking about I wanted to tell you guys You know, I there was like a I've always been sort of like, okay, Biden's gonna win Biden's gonna win Biden's gonna win And then there's a weird thing that I did and you guys can see it in the FEC filings But I gave a million bucks this year in the elections But I gave 750 to the Senate and I gave 250 to buy and I didn't understand why I did it And I and I and I explained it to Nat as She's like, why did you do it that way? And the best way that I could explain it is I I think that there are so much I don't know about what is driving the vote for president that I wanted to make sure that You know, there are checks and balances and the best check and balance was to you know, make sure that there was actually some Senate Check and balance on Biden, I mean on on Trump.

So, you know, I'm I'm gonna Jason. I'm gonna accept the result I'm gonna try to figure out what the fuck I don't know because this is yet another layer of Clearly don't know what the hell is going on But I can tell you pretty assuredly guys any result that's called tonight. I think is going to be Incomplete because they're not gonna call Pennsylvania because they're not gonna call Philly And so if there are in fact Three no, I think that the exact math is about 350,000 votes 350,000 votes that show up in Philadelphia a gap of 350,000 votes that show up in Philly Biden will do what he needs to do by the way, how many people live in Philly? Does anybody know how many registered voters Friedberg's design is it is that on Billy there's a look at a man.

It's supposed to be like half a million votes coming in there And I think they've counted a hundred thousand And so I think it'd be more than half a million usually the dims Margin is about half a million the margin. Yeah, Philly is I want to say our fifth or sixth largest market They've actually got it lifted on the pretty significant population on that that link. I sent you there Nick And then if you click on click to view precinct reporting You can see the area. Sorry. It's tough to read Yeah, I mean we care about Allegheny and then what else do we care about? You care about Philly and you care about those immediate suburbs outside of Philly like Box County and Chester County and There's a there's four or five ringed suburbs of Philly that used to be the centerpiece of country club Republicanism there the counties that elected Arlen Specter to the Senate but over time as the Republicans moved right They moved more to or toward the Democrats Michael.

Do you know why they're gonna stop reporting? They're gonna stop reporting mail in ballots tonight. Why would they do that? Probably just to go home and sleep for a while before they pick it up tomorrow, Pennsylvania Unfortunately and Michigan as well our states that aren't allowed to start tabulating until all the polls are closed That's why those states in the Sun Belt. We were all looking for To be a early bellwether because look at that guys. They can count 4.81 but this is unbelievable Unbelievable Unbelievable Well, what are we seeing here? What's unbelievable? So what that means Jason is that? In Philadelphia, there are 1706 precincts, okay of those only 82 have reported the their ballot tallies So you have 95% of the precincts in Philly Not reporting if you take Michael's framework and say there's a swing of 500,000 votes if it goes Historically Democrat as it has in the past you attack on 500,000 net new votes to To buy them and you know and he he eeks out a win.

Yeah, he goes blue probably in that scenario So that would be a it becomes about remember though if Trump is holding If he manages to hold Michigan He could lose Pennsylvania it wouldn't matter He had a little bit of a margin. He had what he had 306 electoral votes last time So if he holds everything he had minus Pennsylvania Actually could lose Michigan too as long as he carried Wisconsin. He has it has to have one of those two But I think Wisconsin's difficult So by the way for all of our listeners and watchers in New Jersey, they legalize recreational pots So go out and get Yeah, I'm gonna I just took four gummies after my little tirade there because The two Xanax weren't working So that's gonna get really strange for me in about an hour I mean, I'm gonna crack a bottle of wine or what somebody Got one.

Yeah, this is mostly coffee, but trust me. There's some Irish whiskey I guess I'm speaking to you, but it looks like I'm seeing reports of the sound of Arizona Pennsylvania, Michigan Unfortunately, all four of those states are gonna probably take at least a day Arizona three days. I think to count maybe not this year because So much of the vote was early. Maybe it'll move faster, but they are notoriously slow counters. So Settle in it could be the weekend before we have a result well Okay, so let me just drop this if we don't know tonight What is going to happen over the next week Well, we're gonna be we're gonna be gonna need a lot of gummies Jason No, I mean joking aside I think everybody's gonna be tense Jay I think I don't I don't think you're gonna see a lot of action one way or the other I think that people I think people in America are incredibly good people I think that folks are just gonna sit tight and Hope that the folks whose job it is to do their job do their job I hope you're right, Chamath But when I see a group of trucks surrounding people's cars when I see people bringing guns on both sides horrible people on both sides bringing guns malicious style To specifically taunt each other when you see people getting shot in the street chasing each other down over politics This is something that has not happened in our lifetime.

I mean Phil's very old so he kind of remembers the 60s But for the rest of us under 68 We we have not witnessed Americans shooting each other in the street over politics We have not witnessed people taking people out of their lives because of politics and this is got Trump's fingerprints on it from you mean since this summer. I mean, what about all the looting and rioting and protests? My point is when Trump got an office his character and And his ability to trigger people his ability to abuse people his rhetoric put everybody on tilt I'm not saying people looting stores are correct.

What I'm saying is George Bush and Ronald Reagan your heroes Bill Clinton Obama other people's heroes on this call There was a there was a kindness in our differences and when people conceded they conceded with grace and And this Bush wasn't a hero mine, but Putting it aside. Yeah, I think Ray maybe Bush senior was yeah Look, I respect it And we had a mutual respect for each other that this deranged individual has removed from America And I guess I'm not gonna defend what's gonna happen in the next week because I'm not I'm not defending each other leading up to this I think the next week you are incredibly violent Thank you for that No, look Jason, I'm not gonna like disagree with you about any of that I the only thing I would add though is I do think that the media has been a co equal partner and Sewing this chaos and divisiveness Because you know, we used to have a media that thought its job was objectivity and And neutrality yes, and they ripped the umpire jersey off their back to go after this guy Trump and And and why do you think they did money? It's very profitable Trump Trump has made big money picking aside picking aside is is definitely more profitable to get more subscribers It might also be that they were absolutely Suffering from Trump's arrangement syndrome from the fact that the person lies and that he wants to separate children from their parents at the border Listen, yes, but they're supposed to they have a job to do.

They're supposed to be neutral They're supposed to be a rational opposition to Trump Yeah, but exactly but that but the reason why Trump is doing well or better is because the opposition to him is increasingly irrational and and people have voted for Trump to basically give the middle finger to To the to the media who you know again who are taking sides to these big tech sensors You know who don't want us to read things that are critical of Trump You know and so on down the line. I mean I Tweeted earlier. I mean Rich Lowry had a great post explaining why if Trump was gonna win why you know what why that would happen and It's because he's the only middle finger available to these people and You know, I don't disagree with you He's not being no one's voting for Trump because of his Integrity perceived integrity.

Oh, no or integrity. It's the first time I've heard integrity in the same sentences Trump I thought you're I'm agreeing with that point. I'm saying they're not voting for him because of that They're not voting for him because of even a second term of that. They're voting for him in order to stop Cultural forces they don't like Decidedly by the way two things to say According to The national political writer for the Philly Inquirer Jonathan Tamari his tweet of 735 p.m. Said actually it was even greater than we thought there are still 2.2 million Mail in ballots to be counted in PA about 87 percent of the total So if that's true, then we have that and Philly number one The second thing I wanted to say is that if you actually look at the sum counts right now in Pennsylvania, it's 371 591 votes that separate Trump and Biden So it's you know, not that much guys if 2.2

million vote votes are outstanding Yeah, but if it's if it's too if it's let's see 60 percent or two third kind of to one third slash 40 percent and It's not let's say comes in under that right. They probably counted a couple hundred thousand already. I mean it is still pretty close Yeah Really close. Let me um, let me ask Chumat, do you think that part of the reason we're seeing futures markets jump and the dollar jump and And all the kind of obviously correlated assets moving the way they are is not necessarily because of a Trump win But because the risk of a hung election seems to be coming out of the system right now That it seems like we're gonna have a much more clear outcome here than we thought we would Florida is gonna be much more clear.

That's always a worry state Georgia is gonna be clear Obviously, we've still got Pennsylvania to kind of figure out here But it seems like this is gonna break one way or another whereas a lot of folks were concerned We'd end up in the court fighting over hanging chads for months and there was concern in the markets for months about that Do we think? No, I think that people were basically Look, there's a reason to be long Biden in the markets Which is essentially that there are certain sectors of the economy that would have done very well Those sectors of the economy were probably slightly different than Trump's Under a Trump regime, the reality is that corporate taxes broadly speaking are not gonna go up And so, you know, you can forecast higher earnings power for every stock and so everything goes up I think what's happening right now is more of that relief trade of maybe Trump was winning So you could be kind of long everything blindly But you know the real canary in the coal mine was like if you looked at tech futures tech futures was just going bonkers when they thought he was gonna win Because they will probably disproportionately benefit of just having to pay no taxes because they pay no taxes today I So so that's like kind of like what I what I think is happening on on that side.

I mean Trump is very pro business That's why the markets are ripping, right? I don't know. I mean, I feel like there was a real concern like there was a nonzero case here A nonzero case here call it a 30% case that we were gonna get stuck for a few months with uncertainty and Litigation about where this election was gonna go I think I think it's fair to say that we we still we we could still have that David because we don't if this goes to tomorrow I think it's fair to say that that the game theory would tell you that tomorrow whoever loses Pennsylvania Should ask for an immediate recap, right? Right? I don't know what the pro they have to I don't know what the process for that is If whoever loses Arizona should ask for an immediate recount, you know, whatever is possible under the law I think both Biden and Trump will exercise because let's face it This is the highest stakes possible and so you would hate to not if it's a margin of a few Thousands of votes or tens of thousands of votes or even a hundred thousand votes and you're allowed to do a recount so If that's the case tomorrow morning if we go to bed in another hour and a half or if we finish this thing in another hour And there is no Winner clear winner.

I think markets will be back to sort of modestly risk off tomorrow So David your thesis is that your thesis is clear winner the markets were either way I think yeah clear winner. It's just like there was a lot of grinding expected here that was going to cause a lot of You know trepidation and bouncing for a while that folks were concerned about and If you feel like you're going to have a clear election outcome or whether or not it gets litigated If you feel clear about where it's going to go because it's 55 45, you know, sure they're going to ask for a recount It's good news for everybody.

It makes sense. Look, I think the the market does not want those trump tax cuts repealed stocks disripped after Trump passed those corporate tax cuts so um, if Either trump wins or the republicans hold on to the senate Then that would be a reason for the market to rip Doesn't mean it doesn't mean trump has to win but but but if we have divided government gridlock So between the two of you the best best possible scenario for the market is if trump clearly wins Okay, I think I think we have another Is it the case if we look at the senate races Um, I don't know if anyone I don't know if there's an easy way for us to pull this up But we have go pull that up david and I just want to introduce our next bestie gasty brad gerson is here he Brad runs a uh multi billion dollar I believe you would call it a hedge fund or a fund.

Yeah And he invests large swaths of money in the american economy Has a very see the best travel investor of all time jason calganis He's up there, but um, he certainly I would I would guess brad with covid and airlines being grounded This has not been the easiest year for you. So apologies. No brad brad just made 10 billion dollars on snowflake. He's fine Um, there's no flake man. I'm really Brad uh, what's going on tell us what's going on. What do you know? Well? um, hi all um, you know, it's a um It's a fascinating night.

I mean all markets are ripping We've had a massive reversal in the naztac a massive reversal in the bond market um And it it appears that you know, everybody's now who is worried about a trump victory is now celebrating a trump victory um, you know, one of the things people didn't understand About a clear biden victory is the underlying concern in the bond market Right if there's one thing to explain the expansion and multiples in the market this year Is the fact that rates have collapsed? Right, so the 30 and 10 year went from You know a couple hundred basis points 20 months ago to basically 50 basis points in august of this year We've seen them back up about 40 percent over the course of the last couple months We see them backing up again tonight The fact is the the market is seriously concerned about higher rates Which are the result of both a turbocharged economy too much stimulus on top of You know Uh vaccines and prophylaxis for covid and so you know if you ask me You know, we get all excited about the election.

We get all excited about stimulus and tax policy But the biggest elephant in the room is the fed and rates That's the 80 to 90 factor in the market this year In q4 of 18 and so what i'm What we're looking at, you know, we see the the nasdaq now up 350 bits the futures up 350 bits So that says trump's winning. We're not going to break up the tech companies We see the s and p starting to rise again and we see the bond market falling saying that we're going to have lower stimulus Right in the market So, you know, I I've heard I've heard yall talk about You know a clear victory certainly is better than not a clear victory.

Um, but you know Notwithstanding our own fucking anxiety that we have to live with for the next four years In the short run the market is clearly voting on, um, You know is is is voting that trump is a palatable alternative Um, and I would tell you to keep your eyes on rates Brad what's up? You're on the market brad more more than a great manager of money. You're actually a great human being But you're also very wired into The dems. Um, what are the dems getting wrong if they lose today? Well, you know First this is an upset already tonight Let's call it.

This is a massive upset Relative to expectations when I lose the reversal In in the betting markets the reversal in the stock market You know, I was just earlier tonight You know a well known organizers house, uh on the democratic side. I mean there is despondency This is a massive upset by trump And once again a massive misread by the Progressives and organizers in the democratic party, you know, I had my 84 year old mother out here from michigan over the last weekend and I'll tell you that ordinary people Are made to be to feel bad about themselves By people living in these parts the sanctimony that exists in urban areas You know and coastal elites is just It's You know, this is what we're seeing people vote again Right the idea that you're going to close down the state of michigan not allow people to take their boats out on lakes This is just, you know, not something that people are willing to tolerate and I think more than anything else tonight You see a protest vote against sanctimony Um, and this is just ordinary people saying that, you know, let us live our lives Don't act so much smarter than us Um, you know, I think that's a good thing Um, you know, and you know, I asked my 84 year old mother, you know, who she voted for she goes Don't ask me who I voted for that's none of your business, right? Like that's her way of telling me, right that uh You know that she's frustrated by how people in san francisco make her feel Living in michigan.

I think that's I think that's brand that's so smart, but david sax before you talk. He's talking about you I mean, I'm on twitter and I Echoed Technologically, I mean, it's usually vcs Basically, they can't comprehend how somebody could have a political opinion that's different than them without that person literally being evil I mean, I see this on twitter over and over and over again. I'm like really Yeah, but but but but this is like most of silicon valley and I'm just like look I mean political opinions are like assholes. I mean everyone's got one and to think that yours is a lot prettier than everybody else's a bit ridiculous Um, oh welcome everybody to the podcast if you're just tuning in well the family hour just ended there we go Wait brad brad can I ask a question? Sure what? Um Like what what do we do? Yeah, you know for me listen a trump victory the reality is we've learned to tolerate The anxiety over the last four years and I think the market's fully prepared to To manage its way through another four years of trump.

So I think that's you know, the reason We're seeing the the futures react the way they are is it's a whole lot of nothing I mean the fact of the matter is you're most asking how do we get off of our horses if we're on horses? the social elites well, I mean This is gonna be a big one This is gonna take a complete rewiring right like an abandonment of You know the I mean listen you you and I all know the exodus of people out of the Bay Area right now Right the fact of the matter is like pragmatic politics in the Democratic Party in the state of California vacated long ago And you know that is not a recipe for victory.

It's not a recipe for victory at a national level It's not a recipe for victory or tolerable victory at a state level. I think we're gonna have the single largest migration of economic Uh the single largest economic migration in the history of this country the convergence of covet which allows people to work from anywhere And the risk of changing tax policies in states like California is going to cause mass economic migration And I think that people are voting with their feet and they're voting with their wallets and they're voting You know tonight in in loud numbers.

No matter where this where this comes down This is an upset and a defeat for what democrats expected to occur tonight Do you do you buy the framing brad that this is about political correctness versus cancel culture? Yeah, I think that's I think that's a big part of it. I mean like you know, um I think it comes it's it's it's amplified this year because of covet But it comes down to something very simple which I talked about Um, you know, sometimes my sister likes to call me fancy pants Right. She's like, oh you fancy people live in san francisco.

You have all the answers Right. This is just the way that people in indiana and michigan and ohio They're made to feel every day. You know sit around watching fox news These are not people who are racist Right. Chamath. I heard you say earlier tonight Right. The idea that trump could pull what he's pulling and yet if you talk to all of our friends They would have you believe that it was just a small band of You know racist pickup drivers carrying trump flags. I mean they are their head is in the sand Yeah, this is this is ceos.

Yeah, you know, these are business owners. These are small business owners. These are farmers These are old people. These are young people I mean the the millennials you can't find a millennial in the state of indiana or michigan who supports biden Right. Yeah, I find them And I mean just to add to that point about what they think about people in san francisco Why shouldn't they think that when? tech giants and the people who work at these big tech companies like twitter and facebook are asserting a right To censor articles that they don't like and trying to Assert a power over what the american people get to see and read I mean what a campaign issue that was for trump in the last two weeks I mean whatever twitter and facebook thought they were doing to protect or help the biden campaign I mean what a blunder I mean to give trump the issue of censorship in the last two weeks and then the extraordinary thing You know, we had that that congressional hearing in the senate commerce committee that I wrote a blog about And the amazing thing is right on the heels of that after that hearing when we heard jack dorsi got that You know, he just got grilled.

He got ripped apart by the senators twitter doubled down on censorship after that There's an article by jonathan turley talking about they censored a whole new batch of accounts And so if anything, you know, it'll be really interesting to see I think you know If you think back four years ago facebook was really for whatever reason became the scapegoat For the election. I think this time around it's going to be twitter because they have been So arrogant and their assertion of their right to censor Viewpoints they don't walk and if the republicans hold on to the senate Um and or the presidency.

I think you're gonna see Jack dorsi become the poster child for this new censorship that they're gonna target and the the paradox friedberg is that Had they just let that new york post story be tweeted? Because it's the new york post this is I mean you may not like the new york post it may have a sorted past or reputation But if that had been a new york time story a washington post story or an msnbc story or a cnn story It would not have been banned because it's a rupert murdoch new york post story And because it was salacious Somebody mid level inside of twitter decided to ban it How much of that do you think? Plays into what we're seeing here tonight friedberg, which is This is not Uh A small event.

This is a large group of people saying I don't want anything to do with the democratic party anymore. I just think back to 2016 and um You know everyone has their own priorities their own individual things that matter to them And I remember in 2016 or leading up to it. I spent a lot of time in what we call kind of the rust belt and the farm belt and um If you'll remember this was around the time of kind of the transgender bathroom Um, you know movements line up. Yeah. Yeah. And this was felt very much like a coastal elite Um topic of interest if you're in the rust belt and the farm belt you're like what the fuck How is this possibly something people are spending time on and arguing about and thinking about? and the disconnect between the priorities of the individuals that live in the vast part of the united states versus what they read about and hear about others treat as their priority Um, I think is what partially helped support trump getting elected in the first place because the things that matter to them that they felt were highly consequential Um, we're completely unrelated and not being paid attention to while other folks You know that had the money and the power in the big cities were focused on social matters and social issues and liberal decisions that they thought were inconsequential or shouldn't be a priority and I think that fast forward to 2020 And it hasn't moved in the right direction.

It's moved in the wrong direction where the the disconnect is no longer a passive Difference of priority. It's actually become an active interest Moving against you and so if you live in corn belt or the rust belt or vast parts of rural america Um, you to your point you're now not only feeling that there's this disconnect But you're also feeling like this point of view is becoming Um overwhelming and stopping you from having a point of view And I think whether your point of view is rooted in fact or not. You can base that however you want Um, it just feels like it's becoming a silencing effect and not just kind of a You know ignoring the effect and I think let me uh, let me just jump in here I want to come back to this but I want to just jump to something that bogat just tweeted Andrew bogat.

Thank you for this. Um, Detroit, Philadelphia and milwaukee are all planning to post vote counts tomorrow As they work through absentee backlog. So if we look at the counts That really could mean that philip, you know, uh, pennsylvania, wisconsin and michigan are Either too close to call or not even yet ready to be called until tomorrow morning Um, you know, I think let's take a pause here and let's go through what the swing states are and where they stand at this very moment Uh, arizona is an important toss up state. Correct. Let's pull up arizona nick Uh, let's all just take a moment to look at arizona We're going to go through about six or seven of these states and just get our bearing right now because when we did the quick survey About 45 minutes ago four of us believed Trump was gonna win two of us believe one of us emotionally One of us somewhat emotionally believed that's where we were at Guys, you need to get my Guys before you start this hold on before you start this.

I just want to read a tweet Um, two two tweets number one from nick builton. When do we get to vote on when we fire nate silver? and the second one Wow, wait the second one which is even funnier. He's named nate silver because all his picks come in second place Wow, I mean I I was tweeting you guys for the election I mean the nate silver thing was a joke He would first of all he was saying that biden was 90 favorite and at the same time He said that if trump won pennsylvania then he would become the favorite But you knew that trump was it with a few points of the margin of error in pennsylvania.

So how can you be? 90 favorite but some but but but pennsylvania sort of neck and neck I mean even his own internal projections weren't consistent with each other I mean here's nate silver one of the best sports predictors in history He's been an absolute genius. He stepped into politics and now you guys are lashing. Yeah, but this this is the worst case of analytics Since tampa bay pulled their pitcher in the sixth inning of the world series I mean if we look at what's happening here, it's very clear that there are people who are either Lying to the pollsters because they're embarrassed about their choice or they may actively Betrolling the pollsters so when a pollster calls them They lie to them to have this exact moment happen just like the tick tockers All registered for a trump event.

So now we have a level of trolling going on national level I think this is a simpler explanation and that's that you were not all trolls I think the simpler explanation is that pollsters are empiricists and they're experts and like a lot of experts you you could kind of You can kind of interpret the trump phenomenon of Of overperforming now two elections in a row is a kind of revolt against the experts And they don't see their biases Uh, so the way they should they're they're blind to certain things There's really no excuse for how bad they missed this one because Michael.

They may have been experts yesterday But they're not experts. Well, this is I mean This is what trump does This is why people support him in spite of the fact that I don't think anyone disagrees with jason's opinion of his Of his character is that they love sticking it to the to the eggheads, you know, right? Yeah, right. What happens to um Media like what happens to how we conduct ourselves like do you do you read the new york times tomorrow and think wow? I'm gonna trust the times. I'm not saying you did before but I'm just using it as a generality to sort of Ask the question like what happens to media? No, I think I think I believe in You know all of these polls and all of these mainstream press.

I mean this validates the arguments Effectively that trump has been making Right that you've been told lies That these polls were lies that everybody was trying to manipulate you. I mean, it's this is a validation of those who are flipping the middle finger at washington and at the coast And they're saying we're not going to be told how to believe how to think how to vote um How to wear masks how to wear masks and you know, there's a dangerous side to this 100% It's the end of expertise. I mean, who who who can we ever trust? I mean, and this is putin Well, ironically, it's the experts who got mass wrong.

Remember that at the time that I was Saying that we should wear masks. The who was saying we shouldn't So they were lying. They were deliberately lying to keep uh ppe from being overrun And by so the experts have done a horrible job on cova to jason. I mean look, I think that's part of the reason now The cynicism of trump and his approach to absolutely undermine fouchy and say To and admonish people wearing masks while on stage is a level of danger And and is and is a That's insane. So we know that mass work.

You actually were a proponent of it But yes, of course mass mass should never become a political issue. Donald trump last week said don't wear a mask No, he never said he was he literally made fun of a person wearing a mask Let's just run through each of the states right now Okay, wait, can I kind of respond to that jason real quick? Yes, you can of course look look I you know, I wrote a blog post but going back to april first saying that we should that mass should be the policy And it should never have become a political issue.

Okay Um, it should have been a bipartisan response and it's unfortunate it became a political issue But uh, and I'm not not forgiving that and it took trump way too long to get on board with mass I think right around the time my blog was published a few days afterwards first. He said it was optional You can do it if you want it took him about another three months to actually say that mass were a good idea I agree that had he just gone all in on a mass policy. I think this would not even be a close election.

I mean that was probably the single biggest Blunder that he made politically this year 100% agree. Okay, so we agree on that but but but look but you're missing the other half of it Which is what is our cova policy going to be today? And the reality is that joe biden and all these blue state governors are still on the record as being in favor of lockdowns And in fact, they are doing lockdowns the only reason why michigan and wisconsin But I say especially michigan would ever be in play tonight was because of lockdowns. Absolutely Agree.

Yes. This is a resounding rebuke of lockdowns Let let's just zip through these real quick arizona pull it up nick Arizona here. We are biden 54 if we round up 45 for donald trump 75 percent looks like arizona is going to Do biden next up. Let's take a quick look at iowa Iowa 64 percent in and we're in a essentially a dead heat with Iowa's going to trump jason i was going to trump you can see how that numbers come down Yeah, as they election day vote starts to trickle in that's going to try it so they were one of the states that did the Drop off ballots ballot ballots first.

Yes. I think I think that's fair to say. Yeah, okay. Ohio critically important Let's take a look at Ohio while we're here Ohio Wow, that's really flipped hard with a commanding lead. Yeah, I think you can kiss that one goodbye. Yeah, oh, hi Ohio's done just to be north carolina We are now within one and we just all agree if we were I mean All right, if we're momentum investors I mean this thing is this is a disaster for biden right now Disaster this is a disaster for biden and on top of this all our talk is about the presidency They're not going to get the senate either.

No north north Tyllis is running ahead of trump in north carolina. So I think he's home free and Well, the vote in main is not fully in yet. There's only about 41 percent colin's has a 40 000 vote lead Which is susan colin's keeps her seat. That is the biggest That that is like the mega upset the democrats were we're already counting they were targeting her two years ago after she voted for cabana Yeah, okay, the best As we go through this by the way, just keep this in mind cnn right now shows I mean, I don't I cnn's head must be up there asked her.

We don't know what we're doing But they show 192 to 114 biden Um, well, yeah, because they called they called california. That's right. They called california when the polls closed So that's 55. It went yeah, but okay north carolina. Here we go We we or we did north carolina. I believe yeah, we're at 95 percent reporting and trump has a A lead that looks like he's yeah, unless there's a lot of charlotte out I think that north carolina is over and that by the way that percentage is outside the recount Uh window. I think you have to be within 1 percent.

Okay. Let's take a look at georgia for a quick second. We said that was Do you know if we've counted north carolina's mail in? I think that I think they were all dumped at the outset right north carolina One of the reasons why we were watching them tonight is that like florida they can count in advance And so they dumped done they dumped a bunch right at the outset here By the way, I just got it by the way, I just checked the betting lines trump is it's over a three to one favorite to win the election right now Well later it later it goes the more significant that is Wait, why did it come down to 200 on bovado? That's the lowest it's been That's interesting.

I just got three to one on one of the sides Oh, this is a two to one. Yeah, that's a low If you if you assume that biden takes arizona Trump takes north carolina south carolina georgia Let's go to georgia. Let's give him pencil. If biden wins arizona If biden wins arizona he could lose michigan So georgia is currently 54 box just declared that biden won arizona. Oh well, okay. That's a quick call Uh, biden has to take pencilvania though. Okay. So now this is what i'm saying. This is why this is in place So if you assume biden takes arizona, so that's now on the table Now if you say that trump takes north carolina south carolina georgia pennsylvania florida texas ohio etc He still needs To pull out a victory in michigan wisconsin or minnesota otherwise get this or nevada.

Well, actually nevada wouldn't be enough nevada wouldn't be enough Yeah, otherwise Guys, hold on. Guys. Hold on. Just let me finish, please. It's going to be if trump So if that happens trump needs to win one of michigan wisconsin or minnesota. Otherwise It's 270 268 biden Wow, okay. So here's minnesota. Let's just pause for a second biden with a biden's got a 56 to 42 with 54 percent in so there's a lot more to come in But i think michael you would agree that's a bridge too far I I never thought minnesota was in play the republicans the republicans put a brave face on there And they are making some gains in the rural areas, but minnesota was never in play Okay, time to go to wisconsin time to go to wisconsin.

Let's take a let's pause here We got to do this step by step everybody wisconsin 51 percent to 47 percent Donald trump with 54 percent that too i think feels like a bridge too far or do we not know if they did We don't you know, I think wisconsin is another one who's probably counted their election day vote first so No, so biden is still very much alive in wisconsin. Yeah, exactly milwaukey doesn't come in until tomorrow morning Yeah, michigan. We need to take a quick look at michigan and then we're almost done Okay, here's michigan donald trump at Trending to 55 to 44 for biden only 44 percent are in And let's be clear is this um detroit doesn't come in until tomorrow Okay, is that michigan detroit doesn't yeah that Wayne county vote is very low.

Yeah, look at that 28 percent Lot of more lot more votes there Okay, so we don't know about michigan michigan is very much up in the air Oh, that's a that's a pretty good margin for trump there, but I would say it's very much up in the air But by the way, I if you put arizona and biden's column he can lose michigan Let's take a look at pennsylvania one more actually and trimath is right He could lose but he could lose either michigan or pennsylvania and still He trump needs to win michigan wisconsin one of michigan wisconsin or minnesota.

So basically Forget minnesota if destroyed so okay, so then if detroit doesn't show up and milwaukey and green bay don't show up trump wins pennsylvania But chermak does that assume that he wins pennsylvania? Yes, if I give you if we give him pennsylvania. So again, this is why I think guys Um, it feels like biden As I said, I'm a little shaky on my prediction right now actually I think the the the betting markets are showing It's tightened almost to even and let me ask brad a question brad if the betting markets are saying it's almost even in the analysis We just did isn't missing any information.

Yeah, why are the um futures markets still trading up one and a half points? And and why are things still you know, I think that listen The the the stock markets ripped the last two days assuming that biden's gonna win and I think what the markets are starting to Uh price in Is that this is not going to be a blue wave? There's no mandate here for massive tax reform. There's going to be a divided senate It's going to be hard to pass legislation that's going to be overly onerous That the stimulus package is going to be smaller not larger, which is why the the rates are backing up So I think from a I think from a public markets perspective The idea that we're going to have some checks and balances in place.

It can live with either The the devil we know Uh, or it can live with biden, but it doesn't white want biden with elizabeth warren as treasury secretary So democracy survives I I think scenario three is starting to look very possible a biden and a republican senate and uh I can sleep soundly with that Okay, so We're gonna have to I mean you guys I don't know what odds you're looking at but uh, but I mean 1.9 this I mean that's like That's a huge significant right there It's still good. I give you that but uh I don't know those those numbers.

I it's moving phil. It's moving fast. Yeah. I um, I want to I want to take It's down to 180. Yeah, I want to go back to this topic. Um, that that free work brought up. Um, Okay, guys, look, we'll have a winner and it's going to be close ish um But think of how many people um Like isn't there any empathy for all these people that are that just feel so completely shut out of the system like What do we do tomorrow? Like irrespective actually of whether trump wins or biden wins. I think brad's right We're gonna basically get you know, nothing much is gonna happen at that level But what do we do with the like on main street? Like what are we doing to close the gap between folks so that? You know this entire cohort like literally I don't care whether biden wins by the popular vote by 5 million or 7 million You're talking about tens of millions of people Bill girly is now on the line Another one of our bestie guesties bill.

Thanks for joining us. You heard the question being teed up here This is neck and neck This is not something anybody at least pollsters came anywhere close to predicting and chumat's question I think is a really valid one who is got a greater chance of Bringing the country back together and maybe leading from the middle and maybe healing this wound Because this has been the worst four years. I believe in any of our lifetimes in terms of the anxiety And the anger between people who used to be able to have a loaded question Only I well I wanted to build opinion because By the way, bill girly is the best coach Jason Jason baby is the best venture capitalist in the world.

Phil. Phil. Stop. Phil. Stop hijacking our fucking broadcast Go ahead girly So thanks for having me on I you know, I think you guys have done a really good job of breaking down why People have misestimated this thing. There was a you know, there's such a rural urban split There was a there was a really good New York Times daily podcast about two weeks ago where they interviewed rural democrats and in Pennsylvania that had switched to trauma And and all the voices they echoed were very similar to what brad walked through with his mother and so I do think there's a A true lack of empathy for the the center states and the rural areas from the coastal elites And I'd say part of breaking any of it down would be somehow Trying to separate that I think a bigger issue That has really been on my mind lately is just how tribal everyone's gotten and I I've I've come to believe that the way you can Probably just ruin your mind the most is to just join a tribe and quit thinking about things and the number of people I know on both sides that have run off to their tribe Is shocking to me and and it's just not a way to go about being smart because you know, and and if you anyone that makes fun of a you know A religion that's extreme or something.

It's all the same shit like you're just believing dogma for the sake of it so I one of the things that I worry about about a trump victory is is Just very tactically in my life and maybe it's part of living in california But a whole bunch of people and things that I want to get solved Become more manic if he wins like my kid's school and the companies that I work with and and covid quite frankly I I think that we can't get past covid with trump because the tdsers are so convinced that it has to be problematic and it's just you know, so I don't I actually I don't know the exact path to solve it But I I do worry about just being in a world where everyone hates each other and it just doesn't seem solvable that way Well, this is why I think you know, uh, this the scenario which uh, We've called the soft landing where let's say you had a biden victory by two electoral votes the republicans hold on to the senate Um, I think the radical left gets a big I'd say rebuke um or a shock and we have basically divided government in washington but it takes the whole temperature down because You know trump gets replaced by biden, but you've kind of got you know, basically joe and his old pal mitre and a power sharing arrangement in washington It could be a really good situation for the country for the next four years You know temperature would go down.

That'd be kind of this You know healing processes if you will But you know, there wouldn't be a whole lot of new sort of legislation that we have to worry about I think we would get what we want, which is the ability to ignore washington for four years Yeah, but we wouldn't get a solution to really what ails us which is the fact that there's all these people that just feel completely Shut out and I that really bothers me at some very basic level, which is like I just think like you know, I I fought my family my parents Just escaped some third world fucking shithole to go to canada And you know, canada gave us a lot, but it still wasn't enough for me I crawled and scratched to get into the united states Things work out, but I don't feel like I have a right to all of a sudden um I don't know just like look down on other people or make people feel like shit or not allow people to you actually Think shimoth that biden is going to do that or do you think biden's going to be jason? I think middle ground No, who no jason with the republicans in the senate in the no, no, what i'm saying is independent of what happens we're going to have basically we're going to have a photo finish And what I think what brad said is right The the fact that we are in a photo finish means that there are a lot of people in pain And I think we have a responsibility to get our heads out of our asses And stop this sanctimony is holier than thou bullshit I agree with brad when he says that it really hits a nerve with me Because I feel like there are a lot of people we work with them all it's rife within the tech culture And all these fuckbags think they know what they're talking about all the time And we're doing a disservice to so many americans and we need to wake up and that's what bothers me the idea that there are so many people Who feel like they're just getting so fucked Really bothers me that bothers me So I I I can ignore trump.

I'll ignore his bullshit because honestly He's done nothing. He will do nothing. He is a complete fucking void um But whether it's trump or biden in a 270 268 election The fact that so many people still use this guy as a vessel Um, I don't know that makes that makes me more upset. I think some people I think a lot everyone thinks Has some degree of empathy to the problem I think there are different points of view on the solution Which is where this stuff gets realized the one point of view is we should have less government involved in our lives and our businesses And the other point of view is we should have more support and help from the government And that's where things diverge very quickly um, it doesn't feel to me like anyone Uh in politics is necessarily ignoring what what you're highlighting And I don't think anyone in america does from the rich to the poor to the left to the right Yeah, I think the solutions are miscast because for example like what are we supposed to do? Like with our higher educational institutions the people that are churning out all these folks that are meant to go and collaborate and find middle ground I mean, I clearly like all of this says our educational facilities are completely failing from grade school all the way through to high school Community college college grad school.

It's all just a contrived piece of shit Right. We are completely putting out one in two people for failure Okay, so that much is clear. So I don't see politicians fixing that On either side of the aisle what I mean, I'm honestly, what are we supposed to do? Well, I mean might I just might I just suggest that um, two things um Number one. I think in these results that you see there's a You know, there is extraordinary frustration Right with this with the state of affairs the fact that trump in the middle of covet after four years of tortuous anxiety inducing tweets could even be in a neck to neck race to win this election tells you Right how devastatingly bad people feel about how they're how they're being treated I think that you know I said recently We have to redraft the social contract this idea We've been living under social contract drafted post world war two to, you know, it's pre technology revolution.

We have a concentration of wealth today in the world and in this country like we've never seen. And we have Republicans that are set in their ways who say, you know, no universal healthcare, you know, no reform of the education system. You have Democrats who are demanding that you have universal basic income. I think you have to have pragmatic, smart, younger policy. I mean, the fact that we have two old white men, I mean, neither of these folks is on top of their game. I mean, neither of these, like this is, I mean, you compare Biden to Pete Buttigieg.

I mean, Buttigieg is, Buttigieg walks into the lion's den of Fox TV and tames the lion every night. Every night, right? Let's get Pete Buttigieg solving some of these problems. Let's get some younger ideas on the Republican side solving these problems. But we're going to have to rearchitect that social contract, no doubt about it. You know, and I think the second thing is that, you know, to me, this is going to be a wake up call to the nominating processes in both parties. But let's be clear. Mike Pence, right, has his roadmap, you know, for, you know, how to win the election.

Indiana governor, right, he's going to tap into the same fears that Trump tapped into. I mean, these fears aren't going away, right? The exacerbation of the wealth disparity is going to increase, not decrease. We see it every day out here. And so I think you're going to have to have, you know, the Democratic party who nominates people who puts people, you know, forward, who can, you know, who can tap into this. Brad, who do you like? If it wasn't Biden, who would you like? Buttigieg. Buttigieg, he's a South, this was the, you know, an openly gay mayor of my hometown in Indiana.

You think he can sell? Right. Who fought in Afghanistan. And who goes on Fox News every damn night, right? And has a conversation that leaves Republicans saying, oh, that guy's pretty smart, right? Yeah, I agree that he's a tremendous political talent. Do you think that he's pragmatic enough, Brad? Or he would end up veering more towards, you know, sort of like politically correct leftist socialist agenda and then have the same result. I think that there is a, there's been a doctrine in the Democratic Party that to win the primary, you got to veer to the left, right? You got to contend with Bernie.

You got to contend with Elizabeth Warren. But ultimately that's a losing strategy in the election. And so I think you're going to have the emergence of a middle of the country governor, middle of the country mayor, somebody like Pete, who's going to run, you know, on a smart, younger, pragmatic democratic ticket. I think that's a winning formula. I mean, I think that's the Clinton formula. You know, Obama was a bit of an anomaly, but the Clinton formula was a conservative, pragmatic form of democratic party leadership. I mean, I suspect that in the next three or four days, I'm going to get a call from the democratic leadership, figuring out how much they can count on me.

And my message to them is, you guys can go fuck yourselves until you figure this out. Because to your point, Brad, it is absolutely shameful that we're in, no, no, I'm serious that we are in. I know you are. That's what I love. Well, but, but Chamath, I mean, what you should tell them to do is go form a DLC. Remember the Democrat leadership committee that Bill Clinton forms. So remember what, what Bill Clinton did, you know, when he won in 92, we had three straight Republican presidential terms, Ron Reagan, incredibly successful president, then his successor, basically Reagan won a Bush, won a third term for Reagan, but he was a weak candidate.

And Clinton came in there. What did he do? He triangulated, he tacked toward the center. And, you know, he, he actually passed a lot of bipartisan legislation. David, David, let me make this even more blunt. Okay. My million bucks will grow to $10 million a per election to $50 million per election as I get older. Okay. So these motherfuckers want a single goddamn dollar for me. What I want first is a root cause analysis to understand what is actually going on. So to your point, before you fix it, you need to be honest and identify the problem.

Well, I mean, I think that I think it's, it's because that the issue that Trump ran against was that Joe Biden was a Trojan horse for radical, for a radical left that really owns the Democratic Party right now. That's what he ran against. Bill Gurley, what do you think the issues are that if we were going to try to have a great reconciliation between these two parties, between middle America and the coastal elites where you have spent, you know, large swaths of your life, I think perhaps you're the only person here who has lived in both places, middle of America.

Redicitors from Indiana. Okay, but I trust your judgment on these issues. Well, what does the, what does the, what are the coasts need to understand about the people who believe, who live between the coasts and what they're trying to express to us? And how can we as coastal occupants and citizens do to kind of bridge this gap other than just moving to Austin and get in the hell out of California, which is devolving, which is what I feel like doing at this point. Well, I have two comments on this. One, you know, having, having listened to, you know, as much as I can on all of the voter conversations including this call, I'm not a hundred percent sure that these people feel unrepresented.

I think a lot of them want to be left alone. And so part, part of what's being engineered or what they fear is being engineered is someone sitting in a city with views that are very different than them telling them that this is the world they have to live by. And I think the lockdown fit in with that, but a lot of other things too. That put the daily podcast I mentioned, you know, there was this guy just saying, what does, what does Nancy Pelosi know about what I want in my day to day life? You know, and so there is a notion of being left alone.

Brad's story about his mom was like, hey, we're fine here. Like don't, don't bother me. And so there's a, there's a difference between trying to solve a problem for him and being empathetic to the point of view. And, and I would say having spent a lot of time in these areas and being a slow talker and sometimes made fun of for that, there's a, there's unquestionably a, a, a type of social bias against rural Americans in, in urban cities. There's just no doubt. It's, it's the only joke you're allowed to tell without getting rebuked. In other words, we can make fun of the rednecks and we can, all these all day long, all day long, we can, we can do a Bill Gurley impersonation.

No, they're either, they're either idiots or they're moral. I mean, if we, and this is the thing that I don't understand when I grew up, and I'm curious other people's opinions here and I'll let anybody who wants to jump in on this, it feels like the lessons I was taught in the seventies and eighties, which were America is strong because we're a melting pot. We take the best of all the cultures and we try to make our own out of it. And that you get to make choices for your life and in your city, town and state that don't have to be the same as the ones we make in New York.

So if you want to have a handgun and you want to put it on your waistband in Texas or wherever, and in New York city, we don't want to have handguns in the city because it's a little bit more crowded. We can, we can have that difference and we can coexist. And I don't know when we lost this script that what makes America great is the differences and that people living in different parts of a very large diverse country can have different opinions about abortion and what month abortion is allowed to occur at or the owning of a gun or how tall a building can be built.

When did that get taken off the table and who took it off the table? You know who took it off the table was these hysterical libs. And I think the hysterical as much as this far right Trump, flags on pickup trucks surrounding other cars is absolutely horrible to watch. I have equal disdain for hysterical libs trying to tell somebody who lives on a ranch that they can't have a gun when they've never even been to a goddamn ranch and they've never had to use a gun to protect their family because a cop coming to your ranch is going to take 45 minutes.

And that's what America needs to get back to is respecting each other's different lifestyles whether you're an atheist or you're devoutly, Catholic, viva la différence, let people live their goddamn lives. I think it's in a stew point, Bill. And J. Cal, can we run down California next? Yeah, I'm very curious how Prop 22 is doing. Prop 22 is ahead of Bill Gurley. Oh, Jesus, the goddamn people are allowed. Bill, can you tell everyone what Prop 22 is and why? Yeah, please. Why? Why? Yeah, but and it would transition to a whole bunch of conversations about politics that I feel more passionate about than who gets elected, which is if, you know, in order to solve the problems that everyone's upset about with inequality and whatnot, I think you have to have massive innovation and you have to have job growth.

And I don't know of any waves in history where you get a whole bunch of improvement in in standard living for a broad swastika of a population without being positively aligned with job growth. And what where I'm going with this is my biggest concern about Washington. I used to say the main reasons Silicon Valley works is because it's so fucking far away from DC. And it's because regulation is the friend of the incumbent. And it's the it's the opposite of innovation. It locks in things and it's very resistant to change. And Matt Ridley's new book, How innovation Works, goes through this over a very, very long period of time.

It's it's fantastic. And he talks about why Europe's gotten stuck. And like the top 50 market cap companies in Europe, there's no new interest in 30 years or something like that because of this. Anyway, prop 22 is a California proposition reaction to a law that was put on the California books called AB 5 to the best of my knowledge. And this is consistent with the editorial groups at the LA Times, the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Diego Tribune, is that it was written entirely by a union. The SEIU, who has no representation over over drivers or gig workers, whatsoever, they represent service industry workers.

And they would like to represent over drivers, but they don't today. And I think I think about this like a bunch of people living in Nevada, trying to pass a law for the citizens of California. Unfortunately, because of regulatory capture, which which I think is unfortunate on both sides of the aisle, the unions able through a woman named Lorena Gonzalez is able to get the state capacity law that basically targeted gig workers, which was this new job type that has all these fantastic benefits. Anyway, immediately thereafter, there were several industries who were like, oh, we don't want this for us.

So them and their unions and constituents started calling on Sacramento with Lorena Gonzalez and carving them out one by one. So by the by the time a B five was set to be put in action, there are over 100 industries that have been carved out because it was a stupid law written just to target a single industry. And it was written with political donor dollars. Now, in a moment that I would say is completely outside of my realm of what I expected, all of the newspaper, all the editorial boards for all of the major newspapers in California came to the conclusion that this was a bad law, that this was crony capitalism written with donor dollars.

And they all got behind Prop 22, which is because we have this ballot initiative in California as a way for the voters to tell Sacramento that they're full of shit. And that looks like what's happening right now. Sorry for the long answer. No, no, it's a great answer. And what's particularly infuriating about this, and listen, you and I are both, you know, investors in companies impacted by this is that it's there's a group of people who've been exempted from this. And the list of people exempted all seem to be just slightly more powerful and slightly better paid salespeople, you know, fishermen, psychologists, surgeons, dentists, engineers, architects, lawyers, etc.

And if this had passed or if it still does pass, because we're only at 15 or 20 percent of people have been counted so far, but it's looking like Prop 22 will pass. Well, in one of the businesses I run inside.com, we had to tell all of the freelancers we were hiring who are writers that they would lose their gig work with us, because they could only write five stories a year or 10 stories a year. And Vox, one of the big publishing companies, which is incredibly left leaning as left as it gets, they stopped hiring people in California and they fired and laid off all their California freelance writers.

Nick and what this does to people who are doing gig economy, 70 percent of them are working part time. Nick, can you go back to can you I need to switch topics? Nick, can you go to Georgia, please, for a second? Little little late breaking data over 400,000 votes outstanding in Atlanta and the suburbs. How close is Georgia? Let's see how. Oh, my God, it's a statistical dead heat. If you add back in 400,000 for all by now, I'm just saying that's not where it's going to be. But they will all be by. Yeah, I mean, Atlanta, Atlanta should go 70 percent by.

Oh, sure, it will. Yeah, maybe 75, 80. But I guess he'd have to be 100 to zero to catch up. If I'm reading that right, anyone, anyone here cynical enough to think that there's some operative in these states holding these on purpose so that they can be the center of importance tomorrow? No, I just think it's it's almost midnight on the east coast. And people are tired and they're going to go home and have a shitshow or in a shave and start again tomorrow. That's the reason early is so successful. Always early always knows how to diagnose the individual motivation.

And he can diagnose the shit out of it by just thinking about what one guy's motive is and then he's figured the whole thing out. He makes a billion dollars over master of self interest. Bill Gurley, true. Here's what it comes down to. So Trump needs to win two out of four of these states, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan. And he's got to win two of those four. So it's got to be probably Pennsylvania and Michigan or Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But he's got to win. If he loses Nevada, he needs to win two out of those three Rust Belt states or he wins Nevada plus like a Pennsylvania.

Yeah, this is going to be this is going to be really Michigan. It's going to go to Trump is going to come down to Pennsylvania and really to the to the Philly suburbs. I was reading on Twitter, election official in Michigan says, don't expect results before Friday. That's crazy. Well, and by the way, I mean, so so so. But let's just think for a second how extraordinary it is that Trump looks like he might win Michigan. I mean, just to go back to the, you know, the theory of the of the case that we were laying out earlier about how China, about how Trump picked up this, this China trade issue four years ago.

And and this this time he combined it with the lockdown issue. I mean, it's really amazing that that state is leaning Trump right now. Michigan, Michigan was two issues. It was, you know, working class Democrats feeling like Trump standing up for them with respect to China and it was locked down and locked down. It wasn't was an overwhelming issue. You know, for my for my friends and my folks in Michigan, for sure. Can we go back to prop 22 for a second, Jason? Because I think that this is, you know, this is a an issue of extreme importance.

You know, one of the things that Bill didn't say is, you know, we're talking earlier, Chimoth brought up, you know, what's the third way? You know, we we we've we've built a social contract on the back of kind of W2 tied employment for the better part of the last 70 years. We now have a massive part of the economy that's gigging. It's not just this is all freelancers. This is all part time workers and post COVID. This is just a massive portion of the economy. And the idea that we're going to tie all benefits to W2 is just totally asinine.

It's got to be rearchitected. And what prop 22 does is say it's IC plus. It's independent contractor plus benefits. Right. It's this idea that we don't have to tie benefits to W2 employment. Right. So the nonsensical no argument against prop 22 that this was an abandonment of the employee is just that it combines flexibility with benefits. And, you know, from my perspective, you're going to see if prop 22 passes, which I think it will tonight, it's going to be the architecture that New York and many other states follow. There's certainly not going to follow the disastrous AB five example.

But we also know that it's not sufficient just to have a bunch of workers with zero health care. And, you know, and so I think this is a, you know, hats off to Dordash, Instacart, you know, Uber and left trying to try to design something that is a middle way. And, you know, Chimoth, if we don't have politicians designing a middle way, right, then we need leadership out of the business community designing a middle way. Well, that so you just said something so, so profound. And I was going to, I would like to build on that.

I think what California shows is that if you have a completely democratic up and down ticket and it veers too far to this coastal, naval, gazing socialist nanny state, then it requires money and companies to basically level the playing field because the Republicans can't do it. And it's possible to fight back. And what's interesting to me is nobody ever talks about, or maybe they do, and I don't just don't hear it, about how the equivalent happens on the right. It'd be interesting to know if you guys know of any states where there's just Republican up and down the ticket and they just veer into such a detached laissez faire where the whole state needs to get corrected by for profit organizations.

But it seems like we're setting up for Democrats versus companies and people moving to Republican states to have low taxes and to be left alone. Well, you know, it's a sensible set of outcomes in California, right? I mean, do you guys not agree that the yes on Prop 22 and SACs, it looks like your commercial property tax proposition that Zuck helped fund may not pass. It's a point. Oh, thank God. It's a point. We don't know. It's a point one percent differential. Yes. Which I agree. It's look that California ballot initiatives are looking really good right now.

It gives me a lot of hope. It gives me a lot of hope about the state because the most anti economic, the most, let's put a business on friendly ballot initiatives looks like they're going down starting, you know, with the win on Prop 22. That's huge. But then Prop 15, you know, we talked about that on a former episode of the all in pod. This was chipping away at Prop 13, which is the great shield of the middle class in terms of property taxes. I'm not saying you couldn't get a better tax regime that would tax commercial property of fair market value, but you sure wouldn't want to give that card away without demanding some structural reform in exchange for it, which is why I thought it was just so stupid for, you know, tech billionaires to be funding, you know, these these ballot initiatives for higher taxes, you know, but this is definitely looking like it's like a sensible kind of middle ground outcome where a lot of folks who were concerned about California swinging all the way left and chasing business and enterprise out of the state, you know, maybe kind of getting reeled in.

And I think it gives some hope and give some pause to a lot of folks who are trying to build businesses in California to recognize that, you know, hey, there there is a thoughtful populace here. Totally agree. And this is this is a great outcome tonight. I feel I personally feel really good about I agree. I mean, if this sticks, it's it is because the big the big issue with California right now is that we've got, you know, people we've got net migration out of the state because it's just so hard for for the middle class to live here and to build businesses here.

I hope what we hear, you know, if if we're fortunate enough for Prop 22 to pass, I hear we I hope we see a coalition among these companies come together and really promote this as a national architecture for a third way for independent contractors, free agents across the country to have a living wage and benefits that's totally detached from W2 employment. I really do believe a bunch of people on this call will we're helpful to an effort I launched around the board challenge. You know, it's high time for the social consciousness of corporate America to take the leadership position and because it's not coming out of Washington.

And there's so many issues that the solution lies among us and we got to stop spending our election nights wondering when somebody's going to deliver us from ourselves. We got to start delivering ourselves. I think it's a very early. How do you resolve that unions? I mean, like, you know, girlies girlie, are you still with us? Yes. How do you resolve things with the unions after this? I mean, if Prop 22 passes, is there a coming to the middle ground with unions and or unions always just kind of directional vector, you know, they're always like a force on the system.

They're not an absolute or objective, right? They're just always pushing in one direction. I mean, what ends up happening with the resolution with unions or is it just a constant back and forth to try and manage the impact they'll have on policy, politics, tax, free market, etc. So from my point of view, if you think about Citizens United, which a lot of people were upset about, I think, rightfully so, because DC is so money oriented, like it's coin operated. And a lot of people have vivid awareness of it being coin operated on the right through corporations.

This is why the most heavily regulated industries are the hardest to break into, hardest to innovate against. What I think they miss is how much of its regulatory capture on the left. And the difference that a union has versus a company is it's a natural monopoly. And so it actually has more power to write regulation than a company does. And it's going to be around every single election cycle. So if you listen to them, you know, you get what you want. And the people have pointed out that the individual that killed George Floyd probably wouldn't have been on the force if it weren't for the union protecting him because of the stuff he had done before.

But, and this goes back to the red and blue and blindness of just being dogmatic to your party. Most of the people I know that are heavily prescribed to the Democratic tribe refuse to acknowledge that one of the big problems in police reform comes from the unions. And you can't see those things unless you take yourself out of that single place. I would tell you that California situation I think is deeper than maybe what Brad talked about. The rule, the law that's causing more companies to leave from my perspective than maybe five is something called Paga, which was passed about 25 years ago, but it's finally reached momentum where it's causing problems for companies.

And this was a law passed by litigators with donor dollars in Sacramento that lets any lawyer bring a case on behalf of the state against a company. And so they're basically like local sheriffs just running around bringing claims. And of course, they'll settle every time the supposed victims are getting about 10% on average on Paga claims. And once your company's been shook down on three or four Paga claims by a lawyer who's only going to give 10 cents on the dollar to these people that used to work for you, you finally just throw up your hands and say, you know, I don't need to hire someone here.

I'll hire someone somewhere else. Cost twice as much to hire someone here. And so I do worry that if any state or country wants to move forward in our new economy, they can't just be completely anti business, anti tech. I have a strong point of view on that, but like it won't work. You're going to grind to a halt. Hey, Jay, Jason, can we go back to the Senate? Is anybody prepared to, I'm getting a read from my analysts who are live blogging to me that the Senate is almost certain to go Republican at this point with Iowa, Maine and North Carolina going Republican.

That would do it. And Michigan and Montana, both in real danger for Democrats. But even if they lost both of those, you're going to have 51 49 to Republicans in the Senate. Hey, Brad, why are markets trading down a bit right now from where they were? I still have it at NASDAQ 280. So I'm not prepared to call that down. I just think that's within. It's bouncing around. And Bovada, I guess, which is the, Bovada just came back up. They stopped taking action now. They've got Trump minus 150. Is that how you say it? And Joe Biden plus 115.

So to, if you put $100 on Joe Biden, you win 15. Is that right? And if you want to 100, you win 115. You win 115. I think that's pretty close. You only win $15. One 15 is very close, Jason. And Donald Trump, if you were to put $100 in, you make 150. Is that right, Phil? How many of you definitely know you're a 150 to win 100. Exactly. Got it. Okay. I think the more surprising thing at this point is it's almost, you know, and I'm certainly going to live to write this, but it appears at this point that the market's going to be up tomorrow, almost either way.

And if you look at what the market was saying last week, you know, just yet another surprise. The market is celebrating the fact that this is a close election. But you know, if it's a contested transfer of power and we have, you know, there's certainly a lot of room for uncertainty to still be injected into this. But it likes the fact that we, whether it's Biden or Trump, who pulls out the presidency, it's certainly liking the fact that it's going to be a close election. Right now, just to give people an indication, Fox News has Joe Biden at 227 electoral votes and Trump at 204.

The New York Times is at 213 and 136 for Trump. The Senate on the New York Times is 44 Dems, 45 Republicans. And I don't know how we're supposed to, who we're supposed to trust here. There's a Senate, the Senate on Fox News is 45 Democrat, 44 Republican. So this is a dead heat, which I think could lean us towards the great reconciliation, which is if Trump comes out of office, Biden becomes the elder statesman, Biden reaches across the aisle. We have a massive balance of power in the Senate. Everybody's forced to work together in order to get anything done.

Am I correct in my reading of this as a non political expert? Well, what you're describing is the great chair in talk, we'll have 78 year old Biden negotiating 79 year old McConnell and Schumer is what 74 75 Pelosi is over 80. Sydney Hoyer, her deputy is over 80. So who do we have in the death pool because two or three of those are dying in the next four years. Oh, I don't mean to make it dark, but just looking at McConnell and his bruised hands and lips and everything, something's eating him alive. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but that's a bad, bad scene.

Yeah. Is that on the betting markets, Phil? That's not on the betting markets. And by the way, the other direction you're talking about Trump who's 74 negotiating, I mean, you know, it's, it's, we've got to get younger in our political leadership across the board. It's ridiculous. Who had a better chance of beating Trump would Bernie, Elizabeth Warren or Buttigieg would one of those three, if you had to pick one of those three and I think it's one of those rates, or you could pick your other, which one would have performed better? Brad, you see Brad, I was Brad on Mayor Pete for sure.

I'm with Brad on that one here. Okay. So Bill, you believe Mayor Pete would have had a better performance. He would have been more inspiring. He would have been more energy. I think that there is a lot of people that want what Brad talked about, which is someone who's, who's rational and calm and, and centered. And I also think that if you look at the history of, of presidential campaigns, most Americans favor an outsider. And I, I attribute that to personally to them feeling like Washington's on the hook and been bought. And, you know, Biden would be an outlier for a lifetime senator.

I mean, there was a lot, there was a lot of excitement around Obama. There was a lot of excitement about Reagan who came, you know, from Hollywood. There was a lot of excitement about Clinton. So, you know, a lot of governors, a lot of, a lot of first time senators is what you tend to see. And so Pete fit that mold. Why some youth and some charisma would be nice. And David, the two Davids and Michael, who do you think would have put up the best fight? Because tonight, if Biden does win and it's feeling maybe like that's going to happen.

It's a, it's clearly a jump ball here. It's coming down to the last 30 seconds, last minute of the game. If Biden does lose, who would have been the candidate that would have beaten Trump if there was another one? Who would have had the next best chance? David's. Well, Biden's still looking pretty good right now. So I don't know that there, I don't know that there was somebody better, but I do agree that I always was most impressed with Buddha judge out of the candidates in the sense that I thought he was the most articulate.

I thought he was the best debater. I thought he was the best on TV and he knew how to reach for the center. And he had the kind of Obama thing of having identity politics, politics working for him, but without making a big deal out of it. And, and so yeah, I mean, he was what you mean by that, Mr. Sacks. Well, he's, he's gay. He'd be the first gay president, but he's not making that an explicit part of the reason to vote for him. But it would have been a first and his voters would know that, but he doesn't want to, you know, he doesn't want to run on the idea of identity politics.

And so, so he's not leading with that. He's not leading with it. I think that's a smart way to play it. It's, you know, Obama was obviously taking an incredibly important first, but he didn't lead with that as the reason why you should vote for him. So I think to a certain extent, Hillary did lead with that. Hillary was going to be the president. I'm with her, you know, and with her was the slogan. Yeah. And I think a lot of people did want to make that first, but I think you have those votes. You need to make the case to everybody else.

So yeah, I think he's a great political athlete. And you know, someone's got probably a bright future in the Democrat Party. I'm seeing some people on Twitter say that Biden's now become the favorite, but I just checked Betfair. It's basically 1.1. It's very close now. Kind of crazy. This is going to come down to this is going to come down to Pennsylvania and Michigan. And it's going to take days to do those counts and we're probably going to end up in the courts. We're not going to check Betfair. Friedberg, who would have done a better job here? I mean, the market already voted, right? It voted for Biden.

He is the leading candidate. I don't know if anyone else would have outperformed Biden at this point. I think, you know, the next in line was a very different ideology and that's Bernie. And, you know, Bernie really is the contrast to, you know, the points that we were making earlier. You either think that the way forward is to have the government leave me alone or to wrap me up in a blanket and give me a hot cocoa and rub my feet. And Bernie Sanders is the, you know, the guy in middle school who runs for class president and tells you the vending machines are all going to be free if you elect me.

And that's a broadly, you know, like everyone votes for that guy. Let me ask you a question, Brad, that I build off of David. I just think the mayor Pete, by the way, let me just say, I think mayor Pete, I think mayor Pete is a great articulate, thoughtful guy. And he's certainly appealing to those of us who want to have a thoughtful, well articulated response to the problems we're facing. But I think that there is a guttural kind of, you know, innate drive that folks want. They either want free shit or they want to be left alone.

And you know, you're going to need to appeal to one of those two motives. Brad, how would you have voted had your choice been, and I'm going to go around the horn on this so everybody gets a chance to think about it except really Brad, Brad, if you had the choice, Elizabeth Warren slash Bernie hardcore socialists, let's go with Bernie, since I think he's even more on the socialist side or Trump. Could you have conceived of voting for Trump over Bernie or would you have voted actually voted for Bernie Sanders? Take your time and you can think out loud when you answer that question.

I mean, I have to say that, you know, I have a nine and 12 year old boy boys and the conversation we had is it's not just about what you stand for. It's about how you stand for it. Character character. And I just couldn't tolerate Trump's character either in my own life, my own level of anxiety or standing for that, you know, and telling my boys that that's a okay way to lead. And so for me, I was willing to vote against my own interests and taking comfort in the fact that four years under any president is not enough to really change the arc of the country, but to send a signal that, you know, how you lead matters in this country and a rejection of this form of leadership.

Yeah, but Brad, if you didn't think that Bernie Sanders policies would actually, I mean, if you thought they would actually pass everything he wanted to do, you couldn't conceive them of voting for Trump. I mean, you know, again, like I would just say that I would have bet that the system that we have would have been slow enough in moving that Bernie would not have been, you know, that when weighing those two evils, right, that, you know, again, for me, socialism versus Trump, are you to me? I can tolerate the mean spiritedness, perhaps myself. But you know, like I'm trying to, you know, I think it is important that we say that like this is not what we stand for.

This is not an honorable way to lead. And certainly when it comes to sitting around the dinner table every night and talking to them about the way I expect them to behave and their form of leadership, you know, that mean spiritedness just didn't work for me. Would anybody else like to answer that question or is it just? Well, I'm not going to disagree with any of that, but I would just like to point out. I'd like to ask a question actually, which is if this president was so bad that he had to be impeached, why wasn't that a campaign issue? I don't remember being mentioned once by Biden that Trump was impeached.

You would think that impeaching the president would be something you'd want to make a major campaign issue. I mean, so I just think this idea that Trump is the only one who's dishonest and unethical. You know, that whole Russian, the insane hoax that they put us through for years, they put this whole country through before the guy even took office. They were trying to delegitimize his election. I mean, come on, you can't just look at Trump's behavior, which I agree is outrageous and not look at the other side and say they're doing the same thing.

And this is like a, they're sort of like co equal partners in this chaos that's been created. David, let's be there. They're co founders in chaos. Let's be candid. All these politicians that we've had to live with in our lifetime are grifters. We know that and their kids are grifters. Putting that aside, do you think there is any chance that the Russians have not bought an inordinate amount of apartments from Donald Trump at extraordinary prices? Are you just making that up or? I'm just going with my gut. Right. Exactly. Yeah. QED, case in point, because you feel it, you can now make it an accusation that the president has received bribes from the Russians.

I mean, come on. Well, we know. And actually, I want to bring up something. Putin interfered with the election. We all know Putin interfered with the election and we all know he interfered on behalf of one candidate. Okay. I honestly like, unless you don't trust the CIA, unless you don't trust the FBI, unless you don't trust our agency. Really? I mean, you believe in the deep sea. You're still holding on to the crazy idea. Well, the Russians are going to hear the reelection we've ever had, Jason. Jason, this is the story is more family forced than the New York Post.

We had Bob Mueller with a team of like 18, like Pitbull Democratic prosecutors and 50 special FBI agents. Let me finish. What happened to Manafort? Who investigated for two years and they couldn't find any collusion. I mean, come on. Except for Manafort. They're hanging on to this, this insane fallacy and you're wondering why the American people are turning against why they're willing to vote for Trump again. Come on. Can't you see the insanity of the other side? Well, I mean, I did see Manafort go to jail and pay a $25, $30 million fine. And I did see that Trump's kids took the meeting with the Russians to try to set up a secret back channel.

So while they might not have been smart enough or effective enough to actually collude, there certainly was a lot of graph going on. This is, this is, this is on the level, if not worse than the whole Hunter Biden hard drive story, which I thought. Hunter Biden's a drifter too. Which I thought was a ridiculous story and attempt to smear up Biden. Come on. But I, for you to lay this integrity issue on Trump alone, which I agree there's some truth there and not lay it on his democratic inquisitors in the Senate who put in the house who put us through this impeachment hooks for two years.

Come on. We're starting to sound a little like AM radio. Let's get it. We did go there. No, sex is a free thinker. I like this. He's a free thinker for sure. But it's like you got, but this word impeachment, this entire campaign is own both sides of this. Yeah, exactly. Hunter Biden is a complete. You would initially say, well, I'm a drifter. Jason, can you say the word? I'm a great with you. Can you say it? Can you say the word impeachment? Impeachment? I just said it. Okay. There we go. I was wondering what happened to that word.

You don't normally, normally when you impeach a president, normally when you impeach a president, it becomes a really big campaign issue. Nick, can you please throw Georgia back on the map, please? Are you guys seeing this that now they're tipping Georgia back to Biden? Who is? This is insane. Where? Well, they're also saying that Arizona may have been prematurely called for Biden. So Arizona may be back in play for Trump. That was really weird that they called Arizona so early, wasn't it? And only Fox has done it, I think. Yeah, Nick, where do you have, how do you have Georgia reporting right now? How much is in right now? Yeah.

Kick on Georgia just for a second. We have 81%. Yeah, the times had it flip on at 9.13 PM, I have a screenshot which shows Biden plus four. And then North Carolina is now just Trump plus 1.1. Michael, isn't it? Well, in Arizona, when they show the president reporting, it's precincts reporting, right? It doesn't show mail ins or by precinct or mail ins or at the state level. A precinct will have both mail ins and election day votes. When they say 81% of precincts reporting, that doesn't mean that 81% of precincts are finished reporting. It's a very misleading number because it means that 81% of precincts have reported what they have, but it doesn't mean they're finished counting necessarily.

So the precincts in Atlanta had probably reported some vote. In fact, we see that when we click on it. But there's obviously a lot of outstanding vote in Georgia. There could be outstanding vote in some precincts in North Carolina as well. And at this point, once you get into the 95% and above range, they do tend to be urban centers that obviously have a lot more vote to count. It gets late at night. They go home. They finish in the morning. Or three days later. If you go zoom in on Arizona, please, 76% of voting reporting.

I mean, how is this possible? 54% basically. I don't know. But in all those states, you're going to have the intensity you had around hanging chads in state counties. You're just going to have massive tension and drama around counting each of these last votes. Yeah, we're going to have five Florida's. You knew 2020 would do this on the way out the door. Yeah. So Arizona, they counted all the absentee ballots, the mail in ballots first, but the in person voting hasn't been counted yet. So you can't call that state if they haven't counted all the in person because Trump's going to do better with election day ballots.

I agree. It's premature. Well, it depends on whether they're considering Phoenix as part of that, right? Okay. Why is Nevada only reporting 1%? In local news, there are now groups of people gathering at Oakland City Hall. So they go there when like, what night aren't they riding in Oakland? I mean, come on. In Berkeley, they smashed a pizzeria window. They do it every other week. Hey, guys, I want to discuss an idea I have that might be a little bit cheeky, but since Jake, how and I were getting into it before, I kind of want to talk about it a little bit, which is I've called the Trump derangement score, which is if you go to Twitter, that yeah, Trump derangement score, which is if you go to Twitter and search Trump from your username, it'll show you how many tweets you've published that you've posted that mentioned the word Trump.

And so I did this before the show to see which bestie had tweeted the most and see what the score was. And my sense is like, if your score is like zero to 10, you haven't really paid a lot of attention to Trump. It's probably like very healthy. And then if you're in like the 10 to 30 range, you're paying a little more attention. It could be a normal interest. Here it comes. Here it comes. I'm going to say 300. If you're in like the 30 to 50 range, I think you pretty much are infected.

There's two strains. There's kind of the MAGA strain and then there's the resistance strain, but clearly you've tested positive for Trump derangement syndrome. And then I would say there's kind of like an advanced level where you can't even count how many tweets there are. You've got to like scroll and like you keep scrolling and you can't even get to the bottom. And that's like a level of infection where you need to immediately quarantine yourself. And so anyway, I did this. And anyway, the winner actually was Freeberg. Freeberg only had, he had a score of one.

He literally only had one tweet mentioning Trump for the last four years. I only had eight, but in fairness, five of them were posted yesterday to advertise this pod. So I was like, I'm sorry. My one was during this podcast, by the way. Yeah. I had 20. You had about 20, about 20. And then J. Cal, you were in scrolling territory. I couldn't even, I couldn't even count. I gave up. I feel for you. I really feel for you that you're hurting over this election. I don't like, I'm not trying to make fun of you or see you.

Guys, guys, another, just another quick update here that, um, uh, DeCop County, Fulton County and Cobb County in Georgia are pro Democrat. They're huge. And they're at 31%, 58% and 70%. And if you play these out, there's somewhere between 400 and 500,000, uh, potential incremental votes for Biden, which would eke out Georgia for Biden potentially, according to just this last, Wow. Just looking at Fox news, I think that they're trolling the Libs because they have Trump at 210 and they have Joe Biden at 237. The New York Times has, let me just make sure I'm refreshing here and have the latest data, 213 to 145.

So Fox is aggressively calling electoral votes, um, at a level that, uh, the New York Times is far behind, like behind by 50, at least 100. What is the explanation of this? Um, uh, this is, I mean, this is nuts. Um, MSNBC 205 electoral votes for Joe Biden, which, uh, MBC has been the most conservative overall. And what happens if it's tied? It can tie, right? We still have that scenario on the table. 269, 269. Uh, uh, yeah, there's probably a way to, to get there. Uh, let's see. Now interestingly, uh, Biden did not get that one district in Omaha, Nebraska that he had targeted, uh, that Obama won his first time that would give you one electoral vote in, in Nebraska, Nebraska and Maine, both you get, you get, uh, two for winning the state and you get one for each of the congressional districts.

So while, while Biden was not going to play an overall in Nebraska, he had a shot at Omaha and that 272, 68 scenario we talked about earlier could have potentially been 269, 269 if that Omaha district was in play, but the polling really missed. Michael, just to jump in, uh, BG, Gurley, Gurley's got to hop off boys. Say bye to Gurley. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. Gurley, miss you best to BG. Speaking of Bill Gurley, uh, how about Texas? I mean, I think, I think Texas is, is definitely going to be Republican, right, Michael? Yeah, that one's trending far away from Biden.

He looks like he's down about 500,000. So how many points is that? No one's called that yet, right? It's bizarre that Florida and Texas are still listed as, uh, in play. Right. So that could explain what J.K. is looking at between the disparity and, you know what, I don't blame Fox, if, if Fox called Texas, I don't blame them, but I think Arizona. Yeah, that might, that might be better. That would explain your difference, Jacob, Texas and Florida. Yeah. Fox, yeah. I think it's 60, 67 votes right there. Yeah. That explains it. Yeah. So the New York Times has not called Florida or Texas, which is.

The New York Times had Florida at 98%. I mean, it's like 99.9 or something right now. If you add, uh, 38 for Texas, 29 for Florida, you're 67, 67 on to the 145, put you at 212 and Joe Biden at 213, which would be one point difference. Cal Furnock and Kelly Loeffler and a runoff for the Senate seat in Georgia. That's just incredible. I mean, Hey guys, a comment and then a question. Uh, it looks like the Washington Post is projecting that California approved prop 22. Um, so there's a, uh, that's the first one. I'm speaking right now, I think, right? Do we have to find us not speaking yet, but he's, he's getting ready to speak.

The implied volatility on Uber stock at the, at the close today was 14%. By the way, every ballot initiative in San Francisco, the city level ballot initiatives passed. One of them, the prop H was good. All the rest were a disaster. So Sam. So the, the state level ballot initiatives were pretty good news for California, but San Francisco workshop. Okay. Not much of that. So, you know, in, in terms of what we were talking about earlier about creating a more busy business friendly environment, unfortunately what happened in San Francisco, I think California as a whole is positive with proper 22, prop 15, uh, failing.

But every single crazy ballot initiative in San Francisco passed. So it's just getting crazier in San Francisco. I don't know if you did this in your household, but with my 10 year old Brad, I went through my wife and I, Jade, we went through each of the, uh, ballot initiatives as many as we could. We listened to little encapsulations of what they were. And we talked about the stem cell one. And I just thought, why is California, which is losing all of these businesses, adding to the tax burden stem cell research? And why isn't that being done by the private sector? If there is a huge price to be had with stem cell, why would we have California send billions of dollars on this when we're losing all the, this government? I'm wondering, uh, you know, how, how people thought about something like that, like the stem cell.

Did you vote for that, David? To continue to have California flip the bill for stem cells? By the way, just before you answered David, I took the pages of the ballot initiative and I use them to keep my white truffles from developing humidity. I mean, basically, the truth of the matter, Jason, is that when, when I don't understand a ballot initiative, I just vote against it. And I didn't really understand that the some, the stem cell ballot initiative or why the even why the, if, if that was a spending priority, why it couldn't just be handled by the state, you know, the legislature, I didn't understand why that needed to be a ballot initiative.

So you know, I feel like ballot initiative, like I'll support them when this, when the state legislature does something wrong, like, it was a perfect example where, you know, Lorraine or whatever the, had this tremendous amount of power and passed this crazy AB five and the people had to overrule that. So I feel like that's where like these ballot initiatives make sense is when you want to overrule the legislature. But you know, it's kind of crazy for to be passing these laws directly when, you know, we don't know that much about them. Concur. I mean, the founders had this vision of representative democracy, not direct democracy.

And that's generally a good idea. So Jason, I don't know, you have to kind of like what director, the results that direct democracy has produced tonight, the initiatives may be saving us from ourselves since we don't have in this state, unfortunately, a viable Republican party to represent us. The initiatives may be our last line of defense. Well, I think, I think you're right in terms of overruling things, but like in San Francisco, you know, every single ballot initiative path, and I think most of them are just. Well, there's no saving San Francisco. We all knew that.

Well, I don't like hearing that. Come to LA, baby. We got a few more years at least. What is the consensus view seems to be the markets are still up, Nasdaq futures up to 80 still. What causes us to wake up tomorrow or the next day and have the futures down three, four, five hundred bits? There's one thing. And so far, it hasn't happened. And if we avoid it, we're going to fade a really big out here, which is Trump declares victory right now. I think that is the disaster scenario because I think Biden's going to get up there.

He's not going to say much of anything. He'll be very kind of down the middle, you know, kind of let's take a wait and see approach. We're waiting until tomorrow. There's a lot to go. Grind it out, blah, blah, blah. But if Trump comes out and says, we won, we're done, let's move on. It's going to be a panic because look, I mean, he's you can't certify Georgia. Apparently. Right. So, you know, there's a there's a path where there's seven or eight states that have to go through on a meticulous recount. I think this thing is back to a coin flip.

I mean, Trump now has to win Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania in order to win the presidency. If Biden wins any one of those three states, he wins. He has to be a three for three in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan, three for three in this. Well, but we're saying that may that may become ungod. So if he loses Georgia, he loses. If he loses Pennsylvania, he loses. If he loses Michigan, he loses assuming he's already lost Wisconsin and in Arizona. So, hey guys, Biden's coming out. But my analysts just run this analysis. If Biden wins Ann Arbor and Detroit by the same percentage as 2016, that's 420,000 Biden incremental votes versus the 300,000 current Trump lead.

Just to lie the math and he wins Michigan. We feel good about where we are. We really do. I'm here to tell you tonight. We believe we're on track to win this election. We knew because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail in vote, it was going to take a while. We're going to have to be patient until the hard work of tallying the votes is finished. And it ain't over until every vote is counted, every ballot is counted. But we're feeling good. We're feeling good about where we are. We believe one of the nets has suggested we've already won Arizona, but we're confident about Arizona.

That's a turnaround. We also just called it from Minnesota and we're still in the game in Georgia. Although that's not what we expected. And we're feeling real good about Wisconsin and Michigan. And by the way, it's going to take time to count the votes. We're going to win Pennsylvania. Let's talk to the folks in Filly, Allegheny County, Scranton, and they're really encouraged by the turnout and what they see. Look, we could know the results as early as tomorrow morning, but it may take a little longer as I've said all along. It's not my place or Donald Trump's place to declare who's won this election.

That's the decision of the American people. But I'm optimistic about this outcome. I want to thank every one of you who came out and voted in this election. And by the way, Chris Coons and the Democrats, congratulations here in Delaware. Hey, John, the gov, yeah, the whole team, man. You've done a great job. I'm grateful to the poll workers, to our volunteers, our canvassers, everyone who participated in this democratic process. And I'm grateful to all of my supporters here in Delaware and all across the nation. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And folks, you heard me say it before.

Every time I walk out of my grandpa's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, Joey, keep the faith. And my grandma, when she was live, he'll know Joey, spread it. Keep the faith, guys. We're going to win this. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh my God, well, there you have it. Guys, before, before, before we just, I just wanted to give a big shout out and thank you to Brad Gersner. Thanks, Brad. Incredible investor and person and thinker. Thank you, PG, for being on the call. Thanks for having me, guys. I really appreciate it. Incredible, incredible time.

And thanks to Bill Gurley, who stepped in and Phil Helm youth. This has been a great first time effort. We had, I think about 4,000 of you at the peak here and certainly 5,000 or 6,000 over the night. This was an experiment. I think a successful one. And of course, I'm speaking about this country, America. What a successful experiment it has been to Jason. Jason, you can unclench your, your nether regions because I think we're going to be okay. I think we're going to be okay. Yeah, it's very tight. Anyway, see you guys. Good night.

Thank you. Thank you. I'm changing my prediction to scenario three. Biden president. Let's do that as we wrap. Besties, besties, besties. I'm still sticking with Biden. I'm still sticking with Biden. Okay. Trump just tweeted that I will be making a statement tonight. A big win. So we, we're either in scenarios, well, I mean, it's not two, three and four or all three or four. Just for, I don't know if the viewers remember scenario one was a Biden landslide. That's clearly not happening. Off the table. And scenario two was, was basically, um, was, was, um, Trump pulling a big upset that's still on the table.

I'd say probably 49% chance for right now, 40, 45% chance. Then you've kind of got the scenario three was the soft landing where Biden wins the presidency, but the Republicans take the, uh, the Senate. And I think it's probably like the 51%. And then scenario four was the shit show that was a totally inconclusive outcome. And here we are. Here we are. So, I mean, the reality is, I think this thing, I mean, I think it's probably at the end of the day, 51, 49 in favor of Biden right now, but we probably have at least three more days and maybe a bunch of court cases.

Yeah. This could, this could be really bad. I mean, we may not know who the winner is till December and this may require another stream court case. I think we'll know within a week who won. Buddy, it's going to be a, it's going to be a white knuckle kind of week. We, um, I think we're going to know tomorrow. I think we're going to know tomorrow. I'm with Trump. I guess, you know, I guess based on the electoral map, I'd say it's 51, 49 in favor of Biden at this moment. Okay. So, Saks wants Biden to win.

Freedberg, where are you at the end of this shit show? I was going as 2020. I was looking at which island in Hawaii I want to go to. I'm looking at Austin and then just to look at our final. The dots are getting a little better for Trump, I wonder who the hell knows. This has been an incredible evening. I just feel better about the market reaction. I feel like, you know, those of us who operate businesses and try and build businesses and you know, have employees and all this stuff. I mean, I'm disappointed in San Francisco.

It's a fucking shit show of the city, but I feel good about the fact that markets are taking this well and it, you know, means businesses will continue to operate and find funding and shout out Billy in Hawaii. New feet. New feet. What's your pick? And then J. Cal and then we're going to bounce. I have to go with the math. I think Trump dollar 60 is pretty significant. So I have to pick that direction.
