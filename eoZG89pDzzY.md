Duration: 1 hours, 8 minutes, 23 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

Okay, so Jason you're gonna send a zoom link great. I'm gonna make love to not that would take 70 minutes And then I'm gonna scratch and shower have a cup you ready a 115. Okay. Yeah, awesome. Thanks. I just puked in my coffee a little bit But okay It's just that he does he gets seconds and minutes mixed up, you know Open that should be the cold open Oh my god, by the way, that's all right these seconds includes Tramot brushing his teeth Oh Hey everybody, hey everybody it is another edition episode 34 of the all in podcast with us today David Friedberg the Queen of Kinwa the science Sorcerer of the pod Rain Man David sacks hot off his 60th birthday bash in Los Angeles Sorry, sorry that was just going by me his looks and the dictator Polly hapiti a fresh off of writing Editorials about himself in Bloomberg congratulations everybody Give yourself a pat on the back for that exceptional Yeah, free burgers are my favorite bestie because he actually showed up my birthday party and like you guys Oh, I'm sorry David David How do you expect people to react in 24 hours to fly to a different city? Yeah, it was a surprise It was a surprise birthday surprise to the gas.

It was a surprise to all the invitees as well Let me tell you guys what you missed out on okay. All right, wait. Let's give background sacks is now 50 years old 72 A last minute birthday party after I bought tickets to the Knicks and the Nets and invited family members Go ahead and now we're the bad guys. We fly down for the birthday They you know, they shuttle you on the cars from the plane to the to the house We get to the house long driveway. There's like dudes making like watermelon tequila beverages while you hang out and wait There's some dude from America's Got Talent playing the guitar or playing the violin in the driveway The bathrooms are nicer than the bathrooms.

I have at home, you know, these these porta potties. They rent it in the driveway And you know, we're all waiting of course sacks is late two and a half hours to his own party We're all hanging out starving But then we go into the party sit down for dinner and then who shows up as our you know dinner experience It's the guy that won America's I American I'll two nights before So no one knows who this guy is except 17 year old girls and myself So I like pop out of my seat. I'm like, oh my god.

It's that guy from American Idol I had to rush into the backstage to get a photo with him. You know, it's sacks is garage And then they have like coolio shows up So we're like sitting down a dinner for course to all of a sudden pop comes out of the woodwork coolio I lose my shit. I run up on the Coolio fan the dance floor I grew up coolio like is like high school jams man I mean that's like in the car cruising and at this point. I'm like seven tequila watermelon tequila's in You know I think coolio thought I was sacks, you know, cuz he's like yeah, he's like oh two South African Jews You guys all look the same coolio comes up starts high fiving me and hugging me and I'm like what's up coolio? Oh my god, this is like a dream come true.

He's like hugging me his face is right next to my face I didn't know what to say and I like I'm I'm all I've had a little bit of tequila and I whisper in coolio's ear I'm like, oh no, I appreciate you I didn't know what to say. I appreciate you My god, I think I saw free work throw his panties on stage to Wow what a nerd I mean, what do you say when clearly clearly you don't know what to say Can I go back to the part where you said that you were dancing and instantly the image? I had was Julie We have to find that security footage Mark McGrath from Sugar Raid performing and he had that dude from cool in the gang performing I'm the game showed up to the gift sacks of birthday wish What an example the rapper the game the game came Yeah, the game I was supposed to do a movie together like 15 years ago and you know never panned out But he still remembered me and he came by to say hi on my birthday.

It's pretty incredible. Very nice Have you guys ever met sex as parents? Yeah, of course. I just 40th. Yeah, they're so nice like they're so nice We spent so much time with them. We loved hanging out with them It was a really really cool party. I'm sorry. We missed it 72 hours is generally a shorter window than most out of city parties, but I have a better excuse I had a corporate offsite for my team. So I apologize sexy. It's okay. We missed you guys. It was really fun I can't wait. Yeah, wait Joplin sends out an invite for a party.

You definitely want to Throw party she does out there a party. You know how to make it. So how does it feel being? This old and just looking so exhausted David. Tell us I mean you do look exhausted. Are you turning 50 this summer? I was I was actually turned 50 in November. I did yeah, I was in quarantine So we're gonna have to have like a post how heavy is that the 50? About 194 Give her tag It wasn't actually super heavy for me. I mean, I think just you do think about hey, we're counting down It's the back nine you want to make good use of the time you have left and so yeah, of course It's something where you're gonna consider You know your life, of course.

Yeah, and just make sure you make good use of the time that you have here Yeah, I think 40 was just a party, but 50 feels a little bit heavy. It'll still be a great party, but it does feel a little bit Metaphysical I guess yeah Okay, listen, we didn't get together on Friday, but here we are recording on a Saturday and Lots of stuff going on the thing I think I'm most interested in hearing from freeberg about is the lab leak theory and I think that this touches on a little bit of the politicization of Science I guess we there's a lab in Wuhan I think it's more trumped arrangement syndrome It didn't allow us to see the forest from the trees and the same words just said by a different president all of a sudden invokes a investigation Yeah, so I mean there is a Covid laboratory in Wuhan.

It is the only one in China and that's where the virology labs where they study viruses Yes, but specifically they've studied Covid viruses They have yeah, that's I mean that's a big class of virus so and it's the only one in China And it's funded by America and China and the who? The Institute of virology. I mean this is this is I mean this is like The one Institute of virology was posting job wrecks two years ago for Specifically for researchers of bat viruses. We know they were studying bat viruses at this place And we want just happens to be the place where a novel coronavirus that seems to arrive from a bat virus You know like it emerges.

I mean, what are the odds right? I mean, this was such an obvious theory the idea that You know Covid might have leaked from from this particular lab and yet we were forbidden From talking about it. I guess till Donald Trump was out of office. I mean, I think there's really two stories here One is Chinese culpability, you know in in the spread of the virus. The other one is the media story Why were we not allowed to have this discussion? Why did the media? Brand anybody who discussed this leak theory as being some sort of conspiracy theorist or a Racist why were big tech companies? Sensor or removing any user generated content from their sites that we're putting forward this theory You know, why was the media and big tech doing this? I mean, is it somehow I can I can tell you why but somehow they were telling us It was more racist to talk about a lab accident then to David because the person who could have explained it in a deescalated factual way chose to escalate it and be emotional and superficial and that was Donald Trump and so I Don't I don't think that you could point to us and say we could have changed how the narrative is exploited All of us are just normal average people on the ground, but there probably is Sort of, you know a hierarchy of like information and there probably isn't a single individual individual beyond the president Who has access to more information? And so if he was if he was just more moderate and normal and basically said hey guys There is a legitimate risk that we need to investigate because Fast forward basically 18 months later and this president who is moderate you can like him or not like him But he's kind of moderate and unoffensive Says basically that and now we have this news cycle about investigating something We should have been investigating 18 months ago just at least to get to the bottom of it What was going on but Trump had to make it such a big deal and about himself and I think that's a takeaway But just because Trump says something doesn't mean it's not true I mean he is occasionally gonna say things that are true and My point is my point is the president of the United States.

You just have to have more discipline Well, but but I think you're right in the sense that the reason this became a forbidden topic is because the media had to act like anything Trump said is is untrue or crazy or It's a failure on both sides then David I mean the the media is failing to be independent critical thinkers and Trump is failing to be a good leader and be clear and that means you have to be an Independent critical thinker the media's first obligation here is to the truth They're not supposed to distort the truth or push forward a false narrative because of the political consequences And and that they didn't want to be seen as helping Trump in any way and that's really what their motivation was But I find it equally disturbing that big tech was censoring the truth on this issue The whole point of having a free marketplace of ideas is so that we can arrive at the truth And how's that gonna be possible when I'm sorry answering? I really disagree with you I think that the the big tech's decision to censure this information was a was a derivative of the first two things like I don't think that decision would have happened had Trump been normal and Then you know Media would have just listened and said okay, maybe there's a chance this guy is right.

He's saying and acting in a normal way Let's go investigate and then big tech would have basically said we don't know the truth one way or the other But it seems legitimate sane people or on both sides So because Donald Trump published mean tweets It was okay for big tech or rather the media to basically portray the correct theory as a lie and a conspiracy and it was okay for big tech to engage in censorship on that basis What I'm saying is the following the president of the United States Independent and whoever it is has a very specific responsibility to be measured to be unemotional and To be about the bigger picture.

That's what the president of the United States is Responsibility is no matter who holds the office and then the media's job is to fact check that and hold that person accountable And call that person in a transparent manner free Berg Yes, or no, is it a viable theory and then let's get to odds and percentages I mean as a scientist Do you think that this is because came from a wet market or some accidental exposure? Somebody eating bad or some cross contamination a bat and a pig and then somebody eats the pig Or do you think somebody from the lot from the lab accidentally brought it home with them? Don't know doesn't matter.

I feel like we need to kind of recognize that bio warfare and bioterrorism Is a real risk and I think more importantly that this moment whether or not it's proven and it will never be proven or disproven One way or the other so it really doesn't matter what will ultimately happen It's we are gonna kind of become much more cognizant of these sorts of threats To the human population. Let me be very specific a Kid in high school Could write up some RNA code Today on their computer order that RNA to be delivered to them by what's called an oligo printing facility Get this RNA booted up turn it into a virus and they could release that thing into the wild There are several very cheap over the counter internet based ways that one could do this So the fact that there's some sophisticated government run lab doing this I don't think matters as much what's really compelling In this whole storyline is like holy shit.

This is possible It's possible that there's either an engineered or discovered virus and it shows just how if these things leak out and they are Infectious and they are transmissible can become a real risk to the global population and it's not just viruses There are other mechanisms of bio warfare that can be printed and created using similar techniques of genomics There are proteins called preons and preons cause other proteins to fold in a mismatched way This is actually what mad cow disease is it's a preon It's a protein that you find in the brain and if you eat this particular protein ends up in your brain It causes the other proteins in your brain that match that protein to misfold and it basically Replicates and creates this cascading effect.

It's an incredible basically like aliens like aliens and in fact But but but I guess my point is like whether it's preons or or viruses there are techniques And there are capabilities and instruments now that all humans have access to here that Theoretically could allow for the booting or the creation and the distribution of truly terrifying tools Biological tools now this comes hand in hand with the incredible optimism and opportunity that these tools present much like chemical engineering Presented in the early 20th century to humanity we could create things like DDT and kill ourselves or we could create things like artificial fertilizer and feed ourselves And so there's this this tremendous as there is with any new technology This tremendous kind of optimism and fear and it's going to create I think a very powerful debate narrative over the coming decade on what do we do with these tools? Is it even possible to regulate them? Where is this going to go and and what are the risks and it's not necessarily just government agencies that we need to kind of be Considering here.

It's the fact that there's a democratization of this tooling which is enabling all right Does it sex does it matter if it was leaked or not? It's free breakfast. Yes, it doesn't matter a big picture Of course it matters. Of course it matters and the only reason we don't know Conclusively that it came from a lab is because the Chinese government wouldn't let they thwarted the investigation They wouldn't let the investigators come in And so the smoke is pouring out of the Wuhan Institute of virology and they will not allow the firefighters in because those firefighters Come from the West we could establish the truth of what happened if they would let us talk to the scientists who work at that lab If they could go what would you do about it? Let's say that you find out that it didn't like yeah Well at a minute well first of all we're talking about a virus has killed millions of people millions of people across the world It's Caused enormous damage to the economy to our economy to economies all over the world You know we have to think through carefully what the consequences would be but it matters a lot How the Chinese government handled this at a minimum at a minimum? We need to decouple ourselves from China with regard to anything.

That's a vital American interest We cannot be dependent on them for the manufacturing of our PPE for our antibiotics for our pharmaceuticals It is insane. So there's nothing we're gonna do We're not there's nothing we're gonna do to China in terms of sanctions if we find out they covered up a leak If there's an accidental leak and they covered it up We're not It acts more as a warning sign for us to do better and be more independent It's a principle of escalation They are still the critical supplier to most of American manufacturing and industry every product that American companies make most products Have some sort of Chinese produced input and so I would start I would start with I think the measured response That's also in our national interest is to reshore Any critical components that we need for our pharmaceutical industry? So drug manufacturing and the Sanctioning China it's about getting our act together.

Chamath you agree with this and what do you think if we did find out that it was in fact a Covered up leak, which I think is the most reasonable Assumption here. What should we do as America as a country global reaction to China? I agree with Friedberg and David sacks in parts There's nothing to do. I think we have to move on I think it's important to get to the bottom of it It'll maybe help eliminate some of the politicizing of science that we've seen as a result of this thing But ultimately what's done is done Instead what I think we have to learn from it is you can't a lacked hotheads and people who are unpredictable and unreliable to basically be our Truth tellers and fact tellers and if anybody but Donald Trump was the president of the United States in that moment We probably could have had a chance of getting to the bottom of it when it counted and whether you support him or not It doesn't matter the style Made it impossible for anybody to really listen that to me is the most important takeaway of that moment Which is he does have a responsibility above everybody else's the second thing is I think this is the most important macro Investing theme that I've seen in my lifetime Which is that globalization as we know it is over and what Saxie Pooja said is what I really believe which is that You have to onshore and you have to move to a place where you value resiliency over just in time And if you look at the businesses that get that need to get built in order to enable resiliency you will see trillions of dollars of opportunity and I really really believe in that that's that's very exciting to me So instead of yeah instead of being anti China, which I don't think is productive I think it's better to be pro America and say hey, let's just figure out how to build this stuff ourselves now Here's the problem though when the rubber meets the road The biggest impediment to onshoring jobs into the United States are the same people on the left who actually Claim that there is no upward mobility and here's why When you go and you want to basically bulk an eyes supply chains You are introducing inefficiency You're also introducing some puts and takes in areas that today have been like third real issues for example The people on the left believe in climate change more than anybody else But when you explain to them that in order to eliminate hydrocarbons you actually have to mine critical minerals and metals out of the ground They're the same people that say no way well, you can't have one without the other and You actually have to have a rational conversation and realize like listen We're gonna have to do this and so for example like Biden this past week somewhat capitulated For environmental interest and said, you know what yes climate change is critical But we're gonna try to get them from everywhere else, but America it's not gonna work So that's kind of where like I'm a little frustrated But those are my two takeaways number one is pass Let's just get past China and let's just focus on the United States and number two is Globalization as we know it is done and we need to focus on resiliency Did you guys read the Wall Street Journal piece on? the miners who in 2012 were the ones who You know we're clearing essentially bat dung bat.

Yeah, and so this this is a really fascinating Turn of events that we're starting to know what this lab was doing if you didn't see the Wall Street Journal's story We'll put it in the show notes. Yeah, we'll put in the show notes But in April 2012 six miners fell sick with a mysterious illness after entering the mine to clear bat guano I guess is what who this poop that poop which is supposed to be a primary source of fertilizer worldwide Yeah, so three of them died Chinese scientists from the Wuhan Institute of virology were called in to investigate After taking samples from bats in the mine identified several new coronaviruses now unanswered questions about the miners illness the viruses Found at the site and the research done with them have elevated into the mainstream an idea wants to smist as a conspiracy theory That's SARS Cov 2 the virus that causes COVID 19 might have leaked from the lab in Wuhan I mean this is just becoming more and more obvious my my gut tells me that our government already knows this Has known it for some time the 90 day Sort of window that they've given the Chinese to kind of give us an answer as to what happened here is Window dressing and then we're gonna start the process of becoming more independent from China because there's I mean it's nothing You could do I mean how could we retaliate for an accident? We're not gonna get in a war over this no one's suggesting that but I think we have to open our eyes to The regime that we're dealing with over in China and just to lay to add a layer to this analysis Novel coronas a coronaviruses are not the only thing coming out of Chinese labs China is also the number one producer of fentanyl Obviously, yeah, yes, and that's another truth that we can finally talk about now that Trump is out of office People haven't wanted to talk about it or they thought that you were hysterical or promoting a conspiracy theory if you talked about it But I just posted two articles in the chat one from Brookings and one from NPR About how China is the main source of fentanyl that's pouring into our streets At first it makes a stopover in Mexico and then somehow it gets smuggled into the US this is a huge problem in our cities and You know, I think this is not this is not accidental, you know, this is This is deliberate Yeah, the Chinese your position is the Chinese government is deliberately sending a super opioid drug into the United States for profit or to destabilize the country and different cities and Create more division between the left and the right because homelessness and wealth inequality is getting mixed up with a Super drug as opposed to a homeless problem.

This is getting a little This is getting a little long. I know it's getting crazy Reflecting back to sax, but how's it a conspiracy theory? We know that China is mass producing the fentanyl that's coming into the US We know that that fentanyl is creating a gigantic crisis of drug addiction to homelessness on the streets We know they could stop it if they wanted to they have total control over that country. What is the conspiracy theory? Yeah, I don't know if that's the equivalent of saying America produces all the world's cars It's not America. There are organizations within the United States that under under the purview CCP is handpicking who gets to run bite dance and ants and they're retiring They get to decide what is producing that country and who produces it You're telling me that What do you think is going on in the federal government when they say to their counterparts at the Chinese Communist Party? Hey, we need you guys to stop producing fentanyl.

Do you think that conversation is happening? Yeah It was this was an agenda item during the Trump administration and talks between What the feedback was from China? I mean, what's the counterpoint? I don't know enough But what is the counterpoint that China would then say like why they can't stop it or why this is still happening? I mean my understanding is there are thousands of kind of you know, call them under regulated factories and facilities in China Any number of which this could be Question it just does China have a fentanyl addiction problem in their streets We don't know And the answer is they round up every single person who's a Hong Kong dissident who would sell a book or if anybody goes to the That's fair Tiananmen Square protests.

You're going to jail for five years They just announced Hong Kong citizens who go to the Tiananmen Square Memorial this year are getting five years and if you tweet about it you get one year in jail. So they can They can control anything in their country just to build on your control point. I tweeted this to you guys in the group chat We can post this as well in the show notes But there was an article in Forbes this week that said friends don't let friends become Chinese billionaires That was the title and the data point that this is an old story by the way, it's like eight years old Just you know, no, no, no, this was written now That might have been no, I think read the story.

I think at the top it says the story is like eight years old But anyway, it is true that Chinese billionaires Dies every 40 days unnatural deaths have taken the lives of 72 mainland billionaires over the past eight years 15 were murdered It's the Wild West over there man 17 committed suicide seven died from accidents and 19 accidents and 14 were executed Suicide accidents put the execute the 14 for can you imagine 14 billionaires just get executed? Is that story real? What is that story from Timoth? I mean well this this maybe is a good segue into coinbase fact check, but this is All right India versus what's up? Well, I'll give you the rundown on the India thing So basically, you know, there there is a right to you know, free speech effectively in the Indian Constitution But then India passed the law effectively, I'll just I'll just summarize it as traceability Which basically means that if you have an online network and you post something in the network If an Indian censor or an Indian regulator or authority basically says hey, hold on This is an issue they have the right to basically have this the the network or whoever owns that network Trace it down to its originating source now That's a really important distinction because there are certain products So for example take WhatsApp where a feature of the product is end to end encryption Right, so it's hopping around in ways that are very difficult and near to impossible for anybody to really figure out and Now all of a sudden that that that element which used to be a feature is Now a bug because if the Indian government says hey, hold on that statement.

I have an issue with I need you to figure out who said that They'll essentially have to undo all their end to end encryption to figure out. So then WhatsApp filed a Court case in New Delhi This week essentially I think asking for an injunction and so I think this is going to go to a head but you have this now State of affairs, which I think is really interesting, which is so You know, we talk about how we have an issue with Chinese censors Well, now here's a different more complicated example because this is the largest democracy in the world and what they are effectively saying is We need to have an equivalent Red button and a set of levers so that we can figure out what's going on when we choose and there's going to be a lot of implications Because inside of India, what's different than America as a democracy is it has lower average incomes It has lower health.

It has lower literacy rates. It has more Religious sort of tension And it's got, you know many many more young people who are more prone theoretically to get, you know Then booze by misinformation and disinformation and so, you know India sees those facts on the ground and probably wrote this law with those intentions in mind, right? And it's had a bunch of these issues by the way particularly between Muslims and Hindus and so what do you do? You know, what is Facebook and what's app supposed to do? What is Google supposed to do? What does it mean for internet rights? I think it's a super super complicated problem.

And do you prioritize? misinformation and disinformation above The right for people's privacy and you're gonna see it unfold in the largest democracy in the world over the next couple months I don't really know how I feel about it to be honest except I do think that Indian government has a right to set the rules of their own country Well and set the rules they are I mean remember they also banned TikTok in an instance and hundreds of other apps I think 60 apps from China have been banned permanently in India So India obviously has a different approach to China, which is we're gonna put our foot down Of course, they're involved in some skirmishes on their border.

But yeah, it does seem sacks. What are you what's your thought? you have personal right to privacy and to end encryption and then you have You know the ability to run back door a back door to it. Yeah, this is another major Sledgehammer to globalization, you know in the in the mid to late 90s We had this beautiful dream that we're gonna create a single internet for the whole world It would create a single common market a single place for people to interact and go and that all of these Barriers these geographic barriers tribal barriers would come down over time And now what we see is the trade barriers have come up and now instead of having one internet for the whole world It's fragmenting into a bunch of different internet's governed by local laws You know, it started with the the great firewall of China creating sort of a separate Chinese internet now you're starting to see country by country regulations and I just think it's it's sort of an inevitable reaction that The power of governments and sovereignty comes before the power of corporations and they're reimposing their will and I think the question for all these companies is gonna be where they decide they're willing to play and You know, I think now I do think it's a very different choice whether you want to play in India or whether you want to play in China because in China When the government tells you to hand over information on dissidents you really are Aiding and abetting what could be political oppression? Whereas India being a democracy.

I don't think the choice is quite the same at all And so, you know, I do think these tech companies are gonna have to decide which countries they want to sort of play ball with And ultimately I think they probably have to make a determination Based on working with the democratic ones and they're probably gonna have to exit the ones that engage in political repression in my First of all, I think that's really well said what you said in my in my annual letter last year I kind of wrote like here's the white paper on how to dismantle big tech and there were two frames One was around taxation which we're also seeing but the second was on this regulator regulatory point David that you're bringing up That's the simplest way to sort of break these companies down Which is if you have to engineer now instead of one monolithic code base Multiple instantiations where you can't even get the leverage of like, you know cross border data centers I mean by the way, there's a really interesting thing that the Biden tax bill also proposes on this dimension, right? It's gonna prevent you from sending IP, you know into places like like Ireland and keeping it there, right? So you can't have all of a sudden, you know code that's running in Ireland that executes Something that makes money so that you can pay Irish tax versus something code that runs in America That's largely, you know user oriented.

That's not gonna happen. That's not gonna be allowed anymore, right? So all of these things are happening at the same time essentially to rain Big tech in making it almost a whack a mole problem inside these companies where you're fighting a tax thing For example, Google's fighting antitrust in France Then you're fighting antitrust at the EU level then you're fighting, you know Traceability and encryption in India then you're fighting, you know inversion of an IP in America Wow, like it's like all of a sudden the lawyers inside of these companies will outnumber the engineers and I think a lot of this is the Downstream consequences of what happened back in January when Twitter and all the other big tech companies Deplatform Trump remember at the time it wasn't just, you know conservatives or in the US who raised alarm bells It was Angela Merkel in in Germany it was the finance minister in France.

I think India Talked about it. I think Modi had a statement about it They all woke up and said whoa a head of state can be deplatformed by Jack Dorsey He's more powerful than the president of the United States and countries all around the world started looking at the power of big tech and Realized that they're subordinate to all of these tech billionaires and oligarchs. Tell me about Coinbase in fact check I think this thing is incredible I mean, I have to say by the way the first thing I'll say about and this is this is the exact opposite of what I said the last Time Brian Armstrong wrote a memo this memo is Excellent and if you haven't had a chance to read it we'll put it in the show notes But Brian's essay is super.

I think there have been a couple of CEO memos in the last two months that I think Honestly should be in the Hall of Fame in the Smithsonian One is the Toby Lutke memo that the internal email he wrote and the second one is this one that Brian wrote because I think this This thing is probably one of the most important things in my opinion that has been written By a CEO which has the potential to lead to huge systemic changes Well, he echoed he echoed a lot of the things we've been saying on this part about going direct.

Don't let the press tell your story Go direct get you get the truth out There basically what the what the blog said is they're gonna start using the Coinbase blog as a forum basically as a media publication for for crypto related things and the fact check part is that when the popular Press gets crypto wrong which they do frequently in Coinbase's view Coinbase is gonna call them out and correct them Here's what he says the increased awareness has been great Unfortunately, we also see misinformation published frequently as well rather than traditional media social media or by public figures This doesn't always come from negative intentions Our business and crypto can be difficult to understand and often people are rushed to post first impressions online making mistakes in the process that other Times misinformation comes with people publishing their own agenda or from people who have a conflict of interest This is not unique to our business or industry, of course So how should companies respond one turn the other cheek to fight and three publish the truth I believe there is a reasonable middle ground between these first two options Turning the other cheek and fighting which is to simply publish the truth You know what to do with the same the way you fight back is you publish the truth? So that to me that's not a choice.

Those are the same thing is you can either Remain silent take the high road which always results in people believing whatever, you know lies are being said or You fight back by telling the truth fact check approach is not about antagonizing or embarrassing others Subraina I'm shrunk But simply sharing what happened through our own channels It also means sharing the good along with the bad with radical Transparency I just want to say that I wish him all the success in the world because I think if if if an as this works With which I think it will because people in the crypto universe are more prone to actually get their own information and do their own diligence I think the spillover effects to other companies can be really positive all of this is going to the same place which is The intermediate layer of traditional media is basically getting whittled down, right? There was a there was a different thing that happened in those last few weeks, which was The Tribune company I think it was Basically got taken private by some hedge fund and in it they talked about what has happened in the industry and the most incredible thing was the amount of revenue that has disappeared from newspapers and Literally from the tens of billions of dollars to basically single digit billions today over the last 20 years which effectively means traditional media's revenue source is going away and If then all of a sudden if you take that media Model away and there are no more economic incentives Then it stands to reason that the overarching incentives that remain are around reputation Which is then about facts and so the fact that Coinbase will have a place that says here are the facts and we're going to put it on Chain permanently on the record.

That's I think a really powerful idea and recent Horowitz by the way same situation They're doing it in venture capital, you know one of the largest and most prolific and important sources of Funding the future they're on the record on chain in their own way right with their own media and and they're now helping to tell the stories Of other folks through it David sacks, you know sacks has put so much content In terms of teaching people about the business that he knows really well But at the same time he's also been able to write about what he thinks about certain things and then eventually On behalf of his companies, he'll be able to say things and do things as well So all of a sudden not all of a sudden I guess we've seen it, but if we had to put a label on this This is the dismantling of traditional media.

It is happening in real time And it's accelerating it turns out, you know as a subject being Interpreted as you're being through the New Yorker right now in your story Tramoth and I am through my business insider profile You know all these profiles that they do they're interpreting your life when people could just tune into the podcast and hear us talk about it Right and it's like you can go direct to the source and listen to 34 episodes of all in or you could read Some interpretation from somebody trying to get paid views well Here's my here's my observation the thing is that people who create Artifacts on a real time basis.

So in many ways we have all collectively now started to create a weekly artifact of who we are as people It leaves very little left over for interpretation and so then unfortunately what happens is journalists trying to write content Have to introduce some form of flourish to stand out Yeah, because if you're just repeating something that was said on the podcast or something that we said in a Tweet there's nothing left to talk about it's kind of already been said and so that's what creates boundary conditions for lying And it's what creates boundary conditions for mistruths and we've seen a handful of reporters back in the day fall You know fall into that trap.

We you know, there was a couple writers in the New York Times that got pinched for lying It's going to be harder and harder to lie. So in many in some ways I'm actually pretty optimistic that that reputation management and truth will be easier to do in the future when This intermediary layer doesn't exist But it'll take many other companies to do what Coinbase is doing and recent us in this podcast Us with our tweets and our memos and our posts. I think it's it's all in the good positive direction Yeah, and and and Armstrong in his in this blog talks about the gel man amnesia effect Which we talked about on this pod before which is I saw that yeah, which is great I love that because you know that the gel man amnesia is you read the newspaper about a topic You know something about you see that 50% of it is just wrong Then you turn the page to some other part of the newspaper say, you know world affairs You don't know as much about and you just assume it's true And we all know that the media is maybe 50% right about everything and so yeah I mean, so this is why we have to hear from experts directly I think it's why it's a decentralization of media.

It's why I think this like heavy handed centralized censorship by big tech is so Offensive and anachronistic is to try and control what everyone can say especially when it later turns out that You know big media gets so many things wrong like the lab leak theory So it's it's this is definitely the way things are headed I would like to invest some money to basically freeberg a platform to explain science Well, that's right here freeberg. Tell us about the science of NBA games and large gatherings in the age of Vaccination I'm pretty sure you got COVID this week.

I'm pretty sure I definitely lost my voice at the next games But I have to say this was pretty stunning To go to a next game have everybody in the arena show their Vax car to get in I suppose somebody could Photo copy one or steal one, you know, it sounds like a lot of work and I don't know what that if there's any penalty for doing something like that But what when you see a full arena Madison Square Garden everybody vaccinated freeberg Do you does it give you any pause as a scientist that this is not a good idea or this is too soon? Or do you think you had guess this is what we should be doing proper risk assessment finally? No, we should do what we want to do.

They have it folks Do what you want to do There's a great science moment way to keep the freeberg ratio high that was supposed to be the science that way We're ready for a monologue. Let's go freeberg. Come on. Let's go free brag. We're poking the tiger here freeberg Why don't you tell this is something I thought was incredible amgen? This week at the end of this week got approval for this really incredible drug that basically targets K.RAS mutations in lung cancer, which has been this body of cancer that has basically been somewhat intractable for a really long time And these guys have cracked the code.

It looks like and now the drug is 18,000 a month. I think but You know, that's that's for insurance to take care of but pretty incredible breakthrough that people are talking a lot about I don't know if you if you were tracking it. No, but I think that there were several other gene therapies. There were several Drugs that got approval in the last like month one of which is this or actually it was about two months ago this drug that Uses targeted CAR T therapy Basically, you know, we all have T cells and We can edit our own T cells now Using this CAR T therapy This is a series of techniques where you basically reprogram your T cells genetically to go after a specific target in your body And so there are now a whole series of CAR T therapies that are coming to market that are actually in market You can go down and go get treatment Today for several these CAR T therapies that you know, not too long ago.

We're really difficult to kind of understand You know being real They take your T cells out of your blood, you know, so you go in you get your blood drawn a couple weeks later You come back to the doctor. They've taken the T cells out of your blood They reengineer them the way they reengineer is really interesting They basically use this technique where they zap them with electricity and it gets this gene editing in there And then they get edited and then they put those T cells back into your in your body It takes about an hour to get them re injected back into your body And then they do their job and they in many cases are being used to target cancer cells.

It's very specific receptors So now the T cell has been programmed to go find that cancer cell receptor They hit the cancer cell receptor bind to it and then eliminate that cancer cell. So essentially In plain English, you're putting this super T cell back on the body It goes through the blood and then it finds something far in that shouldn't be there like a virus or cancer You find anything you want to do here or whatever you want it to find and it snipes it But yeah, what it does remember it's looking for a specific protein and that protein for example can be expressed Only on the surface of specific cancer cells So if you found certain cancer cells that you have a cancer and we know that there's a specific protein that shows up on the surface Of that cancer which is common in many cancers because they all follow very similar kind of you know mutations you can end up Targeting that cancer cell and only that cancer cell and your your T cells go to work and they go and wipe it out I think the breakthrough this week was in multiple myeloma and thyroid cancer.

Yeah, there's a multiple myeloma one Which was a bluebird bio product. Yeah, and then I think it got picked up by Bristol Or someone else picked it up. So they basically paid the fee and they run their own good manufacturing practice Facility where your blood is shipped to them. They do all the gene editing with your own T cells in this facility And they ship it back to your doctor and it gets re injected back into you Car T cell is that what it's called car space T cell? Yeah So cars stands for chimeric antigen receptor and that is the little cult think about it It's like a seeker that's on the outside of your T cell it goes and it finds a specific thing It's trying to bind to and so you're reprogramming your T cell to have a specific um receptor and then as soon as it finds that that that as soon as that receptor binds to the correct protein that's looking for Boom that that cell that it binds to gets wiped out are we going to talk about the crazy media mergers and spin outs that are happening because It seems like just in the last 90 days the entire industry is rewiring itself And it's kind of a pretty significant set of transactions that are underway Amazon is buying MGM which owns most importantly James Bond James Bond has done 20 billion dollars and adjusted revenue for their movies and you can obviously see Many different backstories and television shows around the James Bond So this is kind of in my mind of that eight or nine billion They spent six billions on the franchise for James Bond so that Bezos can play James Bond obviously while he returned If you take a zoom out, you know Um several years ago you guys may remember, you know early 2000s into the mid, you know, odds Um, all the telcos started freaking out.

Yeah, because they were sorry all the media companies were freaking out Because their controlled points of distribution, which were network television and then their cable television stations and the movie theaters We're getting disintermediated by the internet So all these internet companies showed up like youtube and netflix and we're going direct to consumer where consumers were not getting access to content directly without the controlled channels that the media companies controlled at the same time the telcos were freaking out Because it turns out people didn't need cell phones anymore or need phone lines anymore What they needed was internet access and internet access was quickly commoditizing So the telcos were like holy crap being in the business of providing internet service not a great business We need to be making more value per user per year than we're going to be able to make charging them for internet access So the telcos started buying up media companies This is what for horizon and others did and the meeting as well and at and t and the media cut So remember for horizon bought aol and yahoo AT&T bought time Warner and then the media companies the old school media companies that were kind of like still decided not to sell And to stay on their own they decided well, we got to go internet So we got to figure out how to be on the internet and compete in this world where companies like netflix and amazon are going direct to consumers and um, you know, they all started building their own internet services and So now you got to figure out how to do max.

Yeah hulu And that you know hulu was a big one and meanwhile the tech companies that went direct to consumers They're realizing you know what if these media companies aren't going to play ball We better get our own media we got to get a little TV And so then they started licensing buying funding and building their own media companies And so there's a total reorientation that's underway now What's interesting in the last couple weeks is Verizon decided, you know what? We can't be in the media business. We're not very good at it and they spun it out and they're selling aol yahoo and then meanwhile This really interesting deal is AT&T gave up on owning time Warner And so it turns out that the telcos who thought that they could own the media and monetize it You know what? It's just a pain in the butt.

It's another business We can't really figure out how to add value to our subscriber base with these products They're gonna have to exist on their own We don't know how to run them because we're not media guys and they're spinning out So now the telcos the interesting question to ask is what are they going to do next? What's the next move for them because they got to keep growing? Meanwhile, the tech companies and the media companies are just like this and there's 50 subscription services each with their own silo and vulcanization of content and we're all going to have to choose as consumers Do I want HBO Max or Paramount Plus or you know the the bundle I get from Comcast? And it's going to be a nasty battle for the next 10 years Where you where you want content you're going to have to go pick and choose who do you want to buy content from? And so yeah, I have a theory.

I think consolidation happens when markets don't matter anymore and are getting commoditized And what I would say about all of this what it shows me Is that we're now transferring to the phase of the market where it's all about cost of capital And right now the only person that actually understood that was Netflix And Netflix issued billions of dollars of debt and they started to finance every piece of content under the sun And being small and trying to compete against Netflix was not possible And now we're in that part of the market where content is actually not that important because there is an enormous diversity of it So no one single person can really corner that market And so then it becomes how much can you make and how cheaply can you make it and their scale matters? So I think like what this shows me back to sort of what we talked about before on the other part about like facts and truth is this is part of a much broader, you know media puzzle that's becoming more obvious, which is Traditional outlets that push top down content is kind of yesterday's news and what it's being replaced by is more and better forms of user generated content and highly commoditized Professional content and in all of that the economics are going away.

So I don't if you if you are not sure Go and look inside of tiktok The content that individual people create inside of tiktok is unbelievably good And they are training an entire generation of kids To consume content 15 seconds 30 seconds at a time Which has huge implications by the way for how they consume music So for example, if you guys like look inside a tiktok and then go to youtube and look at the most popular videos exactly the same And same thing with Spotify. It's 15 second clips now No, you know these kids want to listen to the hook of a song and then they won't listen to it I see how my kids use it and it's crazy because like they get addicted to a hook on tiktok They try to go to youtube to learn the lyrics.

They only want to learn the lyrics for the part that's in the tiktok Buss it and then they move on bus it challenge. Yes, whatever it is And so the the point of all of that is that content costs are going to continue to go down Which means the economics are going to go down the margins are not that good And so it's all just a commodity that almost doesn't matter. I don't know about that I think for the top tier IP like you can't displace a disney And they are growing portfolio of IP and those things are high margin and you know having 250 I don't know having 250 to 500,000 500 million people paying you monthly has never existed in the history of humanity There's never been an at scale service like this before the closest was Verizon 18 t when they hit 100 million members I'm not disputing that people won't pay 999 what I'm disputing is The denominator of what they're paying for is increasing so fast that no one piece of content matters Jason No, I do we agree with that collections matter right so the IP of marvel disney Pixar put Disney Disney's Disney launched this thing with no direct to consumer relationships with when they launched Disney plus What do they have now 60 million subscribers or something 100 now 100 million subscribers There's something 100 million subscribers, which is incredible.

You guys have kids my kids watch this stuff on You will have it for the rest of our lives over and over they'll put on frigging moana I cannot tell you how many times I've watched the seashore scene of moana. They want to watch the beginning They want to watch the middle part It's just like infinitely reusable content and so disney's content library is so powerful for that particular demographic I basically demographic of anyone with children that it's an instant on kind of moment These other guys like paramount plus and you know HBO's obviously got some special content But it shows how much content matters right the quality of the content for the demographic is so key for this to work All these media companies that have kind of a broad Dithered, you know library of half quality half good kind of content.

They're gonna struggle man because they're not gonna I also feel like they're ringing a little too much out of it with this too much content production. There is like 50 shows about superheroes then there's like 50 shows that are like You know meta commentary on the superhero shows. It's almost becoming exhausting like how many homeland Style shows are they're gonna be how many soprano style shows are they're gonna be game of throne? I'm getting burnt out I think you're I think you're making my point which is that no one piece of content matters anymore. It's all Yeah, so my big takeaway from bezos buying mgm and these other, you know m&a events is It's less about the decline of content even though there are more and more options that ever have been and therefore more competition And it's more about the rising power and wealth and influence of big tech I mean if you look at throughout history Whoever is buying studios in any given era They're the people with the money and power and they're seeking influence.

It was gbc It was golf and western buying paramount in the 1970s an oil and gas company or Robert Evans kids days in the picture So that's right. Sony Sony and Columbia in the 1980s when you had the era of the rising sun So whoever has the money and the power and seeking influence are the ones buying studios That's what bezos is doing right now But I think this time it is a little bit different in this sense that we're reaching an end state of digital convergence where the um Where we're content and the digital distribution are now reaching their kind of final state And so I don't expect these studios once they're owned by big tech to ever go anywhere any I don't think they're gonna be trading again every 10 years.

I think this is the end state um amazon wants this library for their streaming service And I think that big tech is gonna gobble up the rest of these libraries and that's where they're gonna stay You think all media will end up in tech? Yeah, I mean I think I think I think big tech is gonna eat Hollywood Look, we've been on this this path of convergence now Since the mid 90s with the internet and the question was always, you know We we knew that tech and Hollywood were converging and and joining More and more and the question would be on whose terms this final merger would take place And I think that big tech now you just look at the market caps.

There's so much bigger than the market caps of these studios that Eight billion surrounding error It's a rounding error for bezos. I mean it's one day's it's one day's We revenue or whatever or less. So obviously big tech is gonna win this battle. They are gonna own Hollywood But except for the few guys that have scale To actually be six inch full like disney right disney maybe HBO to some extent. We'll see how I mean look uh Zasla who runs uh, this guy's an he's an incredible Media guy and he gets it But they could be like this discovery plus slash HBO plus whatever that combined business ends up looking like That could be a competitor and their babies like there's two to three libraries They're deep enough and strong enough to compete and stand on their own as a tech Kind of platform But what's also really interesting is that all the telcos are exiting and what are they going to become? Right, it's clear what what's interesting is they're not they're not tech companies Jumping hives jump on our fast are important Right.

So so so here's the thing with the telcos the telecom stack is is we know that Tech is taking over Hollywood But the question is what part of the tech stack and what's happened is the part of the tech stack That has the direct relationship with the audience Apple Google Amazon who aggregate millions and millions of consumers? They're the ones who should actually own the content because they are the ones delivering up The content to the consumer and everybody else who's lowered down in the stack who are just the pipes They don't really have a claim on these libraries in this content.

The pipes are super valuable Dump the pipes are the pipes are valuable, but they're a commodity what elon is doing with starlink is going to disrupt them I'm not saying they're not valuable, but they're not in a highly levered position to do anything with the content They're going to keep increasing speed in order to keep you paying 30 bucks Because like now that they're out they realized, you know what we cannot we can't run media businesses and we can't monetize it Well, what are they going to do because they're yeah focus on faster bandwidth get us to gigabit I mean It doesn't matter.

I mean like you guys are like you guys are so fucking old like you're just like talking about yesterday's news. Nobody cares This is what I mean consolidation in markets like this should tell you it's time to move on and focus on something else This is a dead industry with no profit. So chumat. What happens to at&t and what happens to beriden over the next 10 years? It doesn't matter Well, I I agree I agree with that part that it doesn't matter what happens to these telcos. They should be dumb pipes Again, they're not in a leveraged position to create value around content They never should have owned it But I do think there is major major significance in amazon and apple and google and these other big tech companies Owning hollywood because they have they're going to combine The influence they already have with the influence of hollywood And you already have again censorship on these tech platforms Are they going to start censoring the type of content the hollywood produces? I think these issues are going to get more and more important over time because so much control Over our politics and society and culture are being concentrated in the hands of frankly our industry But this is what I think about the other the other side of that coin is what we talked about before with respect to things like coinbase While that's happening more and more people Who have their own distribution are going direct.

So let's just separate entertainment and facts From a fact perspective, I think we're seeing everything sort of become highly decentralized and I think that that's constructive Now there'll be services that will be there to help us navigate But I think that's what's happening with respect to entertainment. I just think like It was our generation was the last one that actually even cared about movies That cared about these tent novel productions that that cared about water cooler type conversations on a monday morning books novels Kids will not understand what the hell we're talking about. They're like, what do you mean? You used to Run into work on a monday.

You don't want to go to the movies anymore. You think it's over They couldn't care less really they play daughter still a lot going to the movies. They love video games Yeah, I mean, they're obviously like that, you know the combination of media attack and They're just the kind of ultimate manifestation of where it's all and it's not just the kids Just look at the monthly active usage numbers that roblox and epic And for yeah, yeah, it's it's nuts And so they are voting every day with their attention and at the end of the day the thing that has never been Improved is the not or increased is the number of hours in a day So chimac you're pointing your point on the telcos, you know as an investor I own a bunch of horizon and at&t stock if you were running that company, what would you do? I would quit You might run it for capital and then buy assets.

Oh wait, they did that you can't These businesses have had horrendous capital allocation for decades And the reason that they were allowed was that they were they were part of a culture of insiders There were other ins were other insiders said that they were important But as it turned out to individual users who are making usage decisions every day They were not important at all and this is what we're learning that the emperor has no clothes So while everybody was you know looking around themselves saying at&t is important and hey, you know Let's go and like you know buy all of these crazy old school media assets young people were like I use snapchat and tiktok and youtube and i'm done.

Thanks. Goodbye talking right and who owns those platforms I mean you're right that professional content is being crowded out to some degree by amateur content But now the the big tech companies own the professional content or the studios for creating them and they own the the user generated platforms That lets the amateurs create the content. So big tech now owns everything No, but you're seeing the next shooter drop because the thing that I think content creators haven't yet realized And social media personalities and influencers haven't yet realized Is how can I own my own distribution? And monetize my relationship that feature Of the web Will get figured out in our lifetime and that's what starting to a patreon and then apple is now Spotify is doing paid content No, these people are doing stripe accounts Direct with their fans those people are too old.

They're not going to figure it out What i'm saying is there are going to be people who are teenagers today Right or kids who will be teenagers in a decade 20 somethings Who will figure this out for whom the idea that if you're a charlie demilio, right? your tiktok's top biggest star with 120 odd million followers That to go through an intermediary to talk to your people will not in the future make any sense And I think david that's that's where the the next thing will change. I just think it's unreliable to expect laser beam mr.

Bees charlie demilio all these people To continue to go through the no because they have they have such guys Yeah, they could go direct some of those guys could go direct now that they're huge but it's it's no different than building a name on the new york times And then starting your own substack it's going to happen. Yeah, but you can't go viral and you can't get discovered unless you participate Not an or you can use the platform and you can have a new relationship you will build scale you will build scale on a platform And then you'll go on your own because you'll want to control and monetize your own relationship It's it is what these folks have done meaning like how kyle jenner and kim kardashian had built incredible scale and wealth Yeah is effectively through that they build scale through instagram and twitter and wherever tv show Now the only thing that they haven't done is they've monetized it through offline goods But if somebody figures out how to monetize it through an online relationship Then what you're really doing is you're learning how to build scale in an established platform And then you on ramp to something else that's also online and you go from there To think that it won't get figured out.

I think is being it's being figured out it's being figured out right now The street is figuring out there's something called ghost which is like an open source version of Substack it is an open source version of substack and people are Building direct relationships and doing their own patreon and if you leave substack you get to take your stripe account with you You use your stripe account so now it's to be a pot you can go on substack for a year leave and keep all your subscribers I think this solution will get figured out Through the crypto community and the reason is because that is by definition to your point jason Fundamentally distributed and tied to a payment and a store of value because that's what effectively this is It's like where is the value of somebody's reputation? And right now we don't have a way of measuring it and you can you can put that on chain in some way I don't claim to know how But I mean people have talked about this is all these different.

I hope I hope that happens I hope that crypto figures out a way to to create decentralized social networks and all the rest of it But it doesn't exist yet and the only way that mr. Beast or charlie demilia or any of these people became stars Is they went viral on youtube or tiktok or insta? They on up on a big tech platform and so right now the strategy is going to be doing both You you use the platform for all smart and then you have all the power They have all the power right now because if they deny you access to one of these platforms Oh, you're talking about trump who cares about trump? I'm not talking about trump.

I'm not talking about trump You're so completely lost your mind. Nobody wants trump in their life, but you okay? You're the one who mentioned his name. You're the one with trump on the on the brain. What are you talking about? We love that. He's bad. You love. He's bad. Would you want to know I'm not missing it at all, but You want him back or not? We're trying to do takeaways on these moves by big tech to buy hollywood studios and i'm telling you it's about who has The power money and influence and it's all big tech.

I'll go out on a limb and say Um, we're we're we're in the sort of the the august of their Supremacy so and again, I would just say david if on the one hand It's a whack a mole problem with governments on taxation and regulation And on the other hand you have a way where you can have distributed social currency and value Wow, I mean these big tech companies are getting bombarded on every single side Um, and I think that's just a hard place to be one last thing for you guys on a market check My 10 year break evens remember We're now down to 242.

It's been 18 days. What is he talking about? My little inflation check my little inflation check and seems like things are trending in the right direction The market's back the market's back a little There may not be inflation. Well, I think what happened chamath is you you put it well I think a couple of pods ago the market sent a signal to biden that look this is too much Taxing too much spending. It's too inflationary And I don't know if biden heard the message but several democratic senators did breaks and they pumped put on the breaks They reduced the size of the package.

They're now talking about maybe the capital gains rate going to 25 The infrastructure bill is you know been chopped in half So I think there's less inflationary pressure coming out of washington. Hopefully Yeah, what I what I heard last week. I spoke to some folks in washington what they said was exactly what you said, david They're not gonna at best. They're gonna get the cap gains Sorry, no movement on cap gains. They don't think it can happen at all. So that's not gonna move. Okay Number one number two is that corporate will go to 25 but not to 28 and then number three They're gonna really tighten the ip loophole Which will prevent american companies from shipping ip to places like ireland to not pay tax They're gonna make it impossible to do things like inversions all this kind of stuff And then scope that down that's actually to your point a very very good outcome for the markets So this was actually productive if this happens if the infrastructure bill gets I think the republicans now They first mcconnell said 600 to 800 billion now.

I think they're they're at 900 billion I think the democrats started at 2.3 billion now. I think they're at 1.7 So hopefully it's being brought down to a more reasonable number. That's not gonna bust the the budget 0.2 1.3 and everybody will have something but here's the crazy thing I mean the u.s. Government debt is now at 100 of gdp. We owe our entire economy It's pretty crazy and there's still other countries that are 1.5 right and double like japan and others. Yeah It's not a precedent but biden biden six trillion dollar budget would increase our budget Debt our debt from 100 of gdp to 117 percent if he gets his way too much It's a world war two level of spending But what is the benefit equivalent to world war two that we're getting out of this thing? Well, also we're have a surplus in so many states that we're doing lotteries Thank you queen of kinwa rain man and the dictator I'm jason calcannis.

We'll see you next time on the all in podcast. Bye. Bye We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all It's like this like sexual tension, but we just need to release somehow What you're about be what you're be We need to get merges are back I'm doing all this You
