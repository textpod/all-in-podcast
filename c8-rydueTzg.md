You're seeing now the the fresh summer collection of Laura Piana this Jason. Oh really is the thin summer Jalee Okay, really beautiful cashmere It's called like the King's cashmere or something and then this is called a lovely yellow boating sweater Anyways, I took socks to my tailor and I took him to Laura Piana and then at some point I just fucking lost them and then I haven't seen him since so You took him to your tailor and to Laura and to Laura. Yeah, well great that the show remains accessible To the every man and woman Oh my god good to see everybody's focused on what matters.

Okay, everybody welcome to all in episode 86 End of the world except for these two douchebags. We thought it'd be really funny to find the exact same outfit at Laura Piana I feel fully styled. What a great look You guys look so good. It's like dumb and dumber in Italy's Hey everybody welcome to episode 86 of the all in podcast We're not dead yet still publishing with us from Italy the Rain Man and The dictator in matching outfits gentlemen How is Italy? It's fantastic and also with us the Sultan of Science himself David Friedberg from an undisclosed conference Somewhere which we can't talk about How you doing off the record this week off the record this week and a little hungover it seems yeah You need a cup of coffee.

Are you drinking a little Scotch last night late night little Scotch I went Scotch and beer and it was a It was a late night. All right everybody We got a lot of news to get through let's just parse through some of the data because data has been coming in and the minutes from the June Fed are out the key quote Significant risks that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the resolve of the Fed So they went from transient to now fearing entrenched Jobs have slipped a little bit. This is something we've been talking about but just to give some context here.

We're still a historic Number of job openings. We peaked in March 11.9 million in May. We we dropped down to 11.3 and 11 million for six straight months. It's just extraordinary if you look at this Fred chart It's just astounding to think that this many jobs are available two for one in the United States there are two jobs available for every one person who needs a job and This they're just Absolutely stunning if you look at the what do you think this is a precursor to? Dropping down dramatically in the white collar sector is what the data is showing What is major wage or major wage inflation? I mean, yeah Work clearly has to be done and if you lay people off The number of unemployment not unemployed will go up But at the end of the day the thing that we know here is we have a structural Unemployment problem as you said two openings for every person Which means those openings aren't paying enough for people to leave the sidelines and get on the field Yeah, or or they've been incentivized to to be on the sidelines Yeah, these these job openings might actually be Indicative of the opposite of what the Fed is telling us right the Fed wants us to believe that they can just keep jacking up rates And then we're not gonna go into a recession because we have all these open job wrecks But what if we should see the labor market is really two separate markets.

They're sort of white collar professionals and You're seeing all of these tech companies that were involved in slam on the brakes really quickly right now So we're gonna see greater unemployment there and then on the blue collar side You have this issue of record low labor participation Yeah, and so you still have inflation there because they can't fill all the jobs Because there's all these like warped incentives around that there are to just put a number on it sacks We're 10% off the peak in terms of participation and if those folks would participate It would really fill a lot of these jobs that would increase the production of goods and services That might take some of the pressure off inflation and it would also increase Monetary velocity right sacks people would spend the money they make which then get us out of this mess possibly I think part of the problem with the feds approach here is that it's assuming that if they just keep jacking up rates that will That will reduce demand and that will stop or slow down inflation and there's some truth to that However, I don't think this inflation is purely a problem of excess demand I think there's also a supply problem meaning that not enough goods and services are being produced and the commodity is the inputs that we need To the production of goods and services those prices are Increased there they've been inflated and that started well before the Ukraine war But I think the Ukraine war has now exacerbated this problem with respect to energy and food if you had seven minutes for your over under For sacks to mention Ukraine you took the under you want just mentioning as a Exacerbator of the situation.

I think that's actually really good framing that it's an exacerbator Yeah, this is a real with this. Yeah, so if you look at The quits let me just give you the quits number because this is really interesting These are people who are actually quitting jobs. It's still at a record high. So this concept of the great resignation We're still having over four million people quit their jobs every month Free pandemic quits averaged under three million a month. And if you look at that chart It's just staggering to think that in an economy that's going down people are still quitting now What is that indicative of it's indicative of people believing that they can get another job? You don't quit your job if you don't think you can get another one or you have some savings available and you want to yolo maybe, you know You know spend a little free time going on vacation or there's a new economy emerging, right? I mean one of the the cases to be made is That the pandemic and the stimulus that followed created a staggering Short shift in the types of jobs and the types of businesses that people you know used to make money and You know a lot of people were able to shift to work from home And when you shift to work from home You have more flexibility and freedom to choose other jobs that you can now do from home and people don't want to work in restaurants They don't want to work in fast food and if they can find another job a Gig like or services like or on demand type job where they can have more freedom and flexibility and more earnings in their life They'll make that choice and this happens so quickly Because of the shutdown the lockdowns and then the stimulus the trillion dollars or two trillion dollars that poured in it Created all these new opportunities and all these new incentives for new types of work And the fact is the old economy the old businesses all the fast food restaurants and the coffee shops They're sitting with half employment and they can't fill the jobs because that's you know that that used to be a job that there was demand for It's perfect.

We can't you know, and I think that I think that's what by the way I don't I don't know if that necessarily reverts in the near term because I do think that there's been a substantial Almost permanent change in some of these sectors of the economy not necessarily all some will revert But it leaves big gaps in parts of economy and maybe fast food restaurants are not gonna be as cheap as they used to be Because in order to get people to work there You got to charge more and there's other parts of the economy like services and you selling stuff on Etsy and whatnot that are working for people Let me just put a number on that and then hand it off to you sacks To just put a number on that the jobs that fell the most white collar off 325,000 and manufacturing 208,000 the jobs that are increasing the most Hospitality and retail so exactly to your point people feel more options.

This whole thing was accelerated during the pandemic sacks Well, the question I want to ask freeburg is do you actually think that these new options of work from home and remote work have actually made the economy more productive? This seems to me that obviously employees if you give them the no freedom over the decision of Their tradeoff between work and leisure and let's make the economy more expensive How so if you take a big step back to the day before The lockdowns started we had a normal functioning an economy that was growing by call it 2% a year and The minute that we enforced these lockdowns.

I actually think what we did was we started a supply side recession It's what sacks said earlier. So what does that mean? Let's just say you're a factory and you make Wheels, okay, just make something really simple You were growing at 2% a year everything seemed hunky dory you had employees it was fine You used to sell your products make 10 15% profits everything was fine And then the day after the government said you need to shut your factory down because we can't have people Spending too much time close together because we need to get a handle on this pandemic.

Okay, so you shut it down And then for the next 12 or 18 months what happens that stuff sits idle These people that used to work for you Get two and a half trillion dollars put into their bank accounts They spend their time doing other things and then all of a sudden people say okay It's time to start the factory up again people want to buy wheels and now all of a sudden you find that because everything all around the world Was shut down. There's no rubber to make the wheels. There's no steel to make the axle There's no people to put them all together and so what happens? Well prices go up because again you gave Everybody else two and a half trillion dollars.

So they're like well. I used to pay a dollar for your wheel I'm willing to pay you two dollars now. Just make the wheel give it to me before you give it to somebody else So that is like the classic definition of a supply side recession There's another piece to that too John and sorry just to finish the point and the Fed Basically confirmed this in the minutes that they just released today Jason Can you just read the quote that you had in the in the notes? Well the one up top a significant risk that elevated inflation should become entrenched if the public begins to question the resolve their resolve I think the point is that you know, we were kind of in a supply side recession and now by raising rates To some crazy amount the end of which we were still not sure about May actually then trigger the demand destruction to have a demand side recession And so I don't I don't know that we have lived in a modern point in time where both things have been true Right, there's been a principle of macroeconomics that you're everybody's always kind of debating is this a supply side issue? It is a demand side issue.

We know that in COVID it was a supply side issue We took all the supply out of the market And now we're trying to figure out when we exhaust, you know, all of the money we've given people And we destroy demand and take the incentives for demand to go away, right? Consumer confidence is now starting to turn What happens then well, we're going to figure that out in the next six or nine months But the thing is you have both that are true. It's not as if the supply side of the economy Has been fixed.

It's not as if everybody is running at 100% capacity It's not as if it was a supply side issue It's not as if everybody is running at 100% capacity. It's not as if all the supply chain issues have been worked out Yep, so I don't know. I just think it's a very perfect complicated situation. Yeah, it's a perfect pivot and just to build on that Chumath the downstream effects we always talk about the second order impact because people are not going to work anymore downtown areas are dying so office space commercial real estate Saxure in that so you can comment on what's happening and and then restaurants and commuting and all the stuff that was happening downtown San Francisco's downtown let Maryland and breed had a press conference and she's been tweeting Hey, we have to revitalize, you know, Soma in San Francisco.

That's never gonna happen. That's off the table It's like Biden tweeting. We got a drop cast prices. Yeah, I mean we have complete politics Don't worry. We got plenty of politics There's your flop gentlemen San Francisco real estate I read an amazing statistic today from like one of the major brokers They they said that by the end of the year, they're expecting 30 million square feet of office vacancy 30 million in San Francisco by the end of the year San Francisco is tiny by the way because of sub leases and and then Tenants rolling off.

So the first thing I did is I tried to Google What's the total square footage in San Francisco? And I think it's about 75 million of office space Oh my lord, I have 40% vacancy by the end of the year. I've never heard of such a thing 40% Let's be clear San Francisco is fairly unique and a bit of an outlier in the circumstance because so much of it was You know tech heavy and so much of it went remote. Yeah, and the city I don't know and it all got crime, but like generally that's not the case.

I mean, you know, New York is apparently still pretty stable, right? And Miami's obviously doing well LA often here's the piece that people aren't really thinking about which is the only reason it's stable is because tenants sign up for long term Leases and this is why it turns out that we work was a pretty bad business model It was because if you're if all your leases are month to month and you hit a recession your revenue gets whammy'd This is why landlords like long term leases with credit worthy tenants They sign seven years ten years and so on letters of credit, right? What that means though is that as these tenants start to roll their leases roll over the next few years They don't need as much space because they've either gotten remote or they're like hybrid now And so they're thinking of their office less as a headquarters, which everyone needs to go to and more as like a Coworking space their employees occasionally go to so they're all reducing their footprints This is why San Francisco keeps increasing its vacancy is that as more and more of these leases roll There's just no need they don't need as much space.

So they're also downsizing Now here's the problem. Here's the problem is that these buildings have debt on them, right? And That debt has was called a debt service coverage ratio DSCR and Basically you become you as a building owner Become in default on your debt components if your revenue from the building drops below a certain number And here's the problem all these new leases that get signed to accept there are any they're gonna be at a fraction of What the old leases were because this this vacancy is gonna create a massively low Market clearing price am I right to understand that they're not allowed to sign those leases because they're under it So can the landlord it's not it's better than nothing or do they are not allowed to take it It's not that it's just that the market clearing prices can be so much lower than their old leases that when they then look at the Revenue from the building and by the way that buildings can have a lot of vacancy on it now They're just not gonna be able to hit their their their debt service coverage ratio.

So they will be in default What that means is I don't understand how in a place like downtown, San Francisco Half the buildings don't end up getting owned by the banks. Well, the banks don't want to own all these buildings So they're gonna be a fire sale, but I don't know who the buyers are gonna be I mean, they just have to convert it right? I mean, that's the only thing that they got to convert these to residential because we have a housing crisis Still that's the only years that takes years and years and that's that's a repositioning play first You need the cooperation of the city government, which isn't gonna happen I mean, you need then you need developers to come in and have the capital to basically make all those changes again It takes a long time but but think about the systemic risk from that right if you know that a huge chunk of the real estate in Is the commercial real estate and downtown in San Francisco, which used to be blue chip I mean the most blue chip right.

Yes, who are those financial institutions who own those assets because they are now toxic assets And they will be revealed to be toxic assets as soon as the leases roll. Well, and then there are debt funds and banks as Well, right and so What are the cascading effects when those shoes start to drop? Yeah, okay And so just to put a finer point also on the jobs and that was our flop net international migration Has just plummeted we're well under a million folks Coming into the country so the obvious solution to our employment issues is to recruit people from other countries But let's go to the turn card Yeah, there it is.

We have just stopped letting people Trump just absolutely closed the borders as you can see 2016 Biden also is in favor of closing the borders. It's also sentiment. It's like, you know America is not the shining People still light on the hill it used to be not in the same way and there are easily have three or four million people coming into The country if we wanted to yeah, but we have three million people have come in just under Biden illegal migration Does that chart count illegal migration? No, this is legal. This is legal. Okay.

Well, so just make sure you count that because we've basically Board policy. Yeah, if we didn't allow those workers in what would happen, okay? Let's go to the turn card consumer confidence conference boards consumer confidence index in June fell To 98.7 from 103.2 in May Expectation was a hundred so it's under the expectation the expectation index so when you look at Consumer confidence there's two your confidence in the present situation That's the blue on the chart and then there's your expectations of the future and what you see is a huge divergence there Starting to happen people are starting to look towards the future as negative, but they feel pretty good about today and so Gentlemen, what do you think of this chart? It seems to me like this is sort of akin to what sacks was relaying about that founder at the coto conference Which is like, you know, he thinks everybody else is gonna, you know Roll up their sleeves and buckle down, but he has no intention of doing it.

I think people Are roughly the same way and I think their behavior is well, you know, if things are gonna get hard I'll deal with it in the future but right now I have money in my pocket and you know if you look at airlines and How many people are trying to travel if you just look at like the cost of a hotel room if you look at what's happening this summer It does not seem like people are slowing down or tapping the brakes in any way. Yeah Yeah, I get concerned about credit because it's not coming from wage gains, you know, the increased cost is there the increased income It's not and you know, we're seeing continued month after month increases in consumer credit balances And that I think you know, this was the point I made a few episodes ago I don't think people are gonna slow down how they're living and how they're spending.

It's exactly what they did to show There's an inertia to I just think after two years of a lockdown I do think that people are anxious to Reestablish some amount of normalcy and this is really the first summer where everybody writ large Can be out and do the things that they were planning on doing fake summer Yeah, last year was a little bit of a headache and look you have two years of pent up plans of you know Weddings and weddings and all of this stuff that's happening. Yeah, and so I think people are really spending money And if you look at it, you know, the consumer is holding up amazingly It's got to be some combination of jobs home prices and this inflation But this is why there has not been a down tick in demand I don't know why everybody thinks that there's been a down tick in demand.

There was an article today I'm rich yet. It's not showing up in the numbers yet. No, I think it is It's just anecdotal and guess very subtle. Okay, sure. It is there is a subtle. I actually disagree with you guys I actually think that the economy is pivoting on a dime here and It's it's starting to show up suddenly in the numbers Here's some other data points consumer sentiment biggest drop in consumer sentiment in 40 years. That was in the last month Right track Ron track polling only 10% of the country thinks we're on the right track If you pull people and ask are we in a recession? Something like close to 60% of the country already thinks we're in a recession.

There's a slight political tint to that more Republicans than Democrats Think we're in a recession. However, even roughly half of Democrats think we're in a recession. So I think those are all feelings not behavior though Sax, we're looking at the data not the sentiment. I think the behavior will catch up with the sentiment I think the behavior is I think the behavior is pivoting Yeah, it's just that I think you have to dig beneath the surface and you have to look at things like retail sales things like that I'm not sure David if you look back on all the number of times consumer sentiment is dipped that the correlation to spending patterns is so Uniformly predictive as we think I mean, I think that there are there's a slight positive correlation I remember but I don't think it's like, you know point seven five point eight one It's not that so there's this weird Preference falsification that happens when you get asked what do you think is going to happen versus and what do you do? Yeah, and I think a lot of consumers That's why they have you know, we know the data in America like less than a month of savings or whatever those numbers are Despite all of the sentiment analysis and all of the stuff you would think that there'd be behavior change but mostly people kind of just live in the moment and you know that that's partly because they don't have the Structural support to save or other things but the reality is that most folks From what they say to what they behave there is a gap.

Yeah, and to your point sacks This is starting to catch up. We're seeing a slight Downtick and we'll go to real estate next But if you look I found I was doing some research on gasoline because that's obviously where people getting hit the most The average household is now spending five thousand a year on gasoline. That's almost double last year So this is gonna have an impact. It's going to catch up But there's so many jobs available and there's so many people unemployed. I think it's manageable So to your point, Chamath, it feels like consumers can manage even this great headwind.

Let me just put a point to it I think the average Per capita income in the US about thirty eight thousand dollars a year that works out to about 17 Bucks and fifty cents an hour roughly Think about a person with that level of earnings The average household in the US has historically, you know Spent about a third on housing about 13 percent on food and about 16 percent on, you know They're car and their gas and they only have about 12 percent left over for savings So, you know, if that 13 percent on food has jumped by 30 percent The 16 percent that they're spending on gas has jumped by 40 percent or 50 percent And even if housing prices take up a little bit All of a sudden your savings are gone and you're actually not actually doubled freeberg.

It's doubled the gas So yeah, by the way, it's worse than you say. No, it's worse than you say because you're using a per capita number Yeah, yeah, and so what but I think what I'm trying to highlight is that there is a distribution There is a group of the United States a small percentage of minority that have earned good income and are having their 50th anniversary Like Chimap is talking about taking their travel and that shows up in the numbers There's outside spending happening with a segment of the economy and what sacks is saying I think is right as well Which is that the majority of Americans are facing this really critical budget crisis where their personal spending levels are now exceeding their income levels And there's a critical need for credit and for personal debt and spending to go down And that's what's going to drive significant risk in the next couple of months and quarters and years Is that the majority it looks some of the numbers will look good because there's a segment of the economy that is Overspending but the majority of the economy is as sacks is saying probably turning on a dime And I think both things can be true.

Yeah, let me let me maybe tie a couple of these things together because I I tend to agree with you like I think that we Have been in a supply side recession. That is what has caused inflation we have to go through a process of Taking all the excess money that's been put in out and When you do that we will destroy demand and then that'll trigger demand side recession because people will asset values And we will destroy asset values So that's already that process asset values went real quick. Yeah, that will happen second So the balance sheets of that segment of the population that is overspending right now Once their balance sheets really take the hit may take a hard look at what their savings are they're going to cut spending Right.

So the point is I think we're still firmly in that first phase and I and I hate to be the bearer of bad news But the reason why I think that we're still in the first part of this process is because people broadly speaking Still have a lot of savings because of all the stimulus checks. There is still a lot of money So what how will we know maybe is the better point when all of that excess savings has been? You know torn away from these people because of high prices. I suspect it's when Jason's first chart starts to close Right.

So when people are you know go or they're more motivated to reenter the workforce I think that's a signal free berg your signal is another one, which is when credit delinquencies Really start to spike. It's because people then you know tapped out their savings then they tap their credit cards And then all of a sudden they become delinquent when all of those things happen You're probably now at a point where that first phase of the supply side issues are Largely done and now you get to the demand destruction, but all of those roads Unfortunately lead to the same conclusion, which is like, you know equities get really under pressure There is no scenario where there's a bit to equities.

Why would you buy something that has lower earnings in the future? Or why would you buy something that has a lower discount rate for profits in the future? In this case both are true All right, let's get to that because the piece we haven't got to so here's the river card is Housing because people's homes are the majority of their wealth here in the United States and that I think will be the true indicator Chumath to your point labor participation certainly won But when this hits housing, that's when we're going to know we're in the end game the mortgage rate just hit 5.3

percent We why why do you say housing is the end game? Well, I I think we haven't seen the collapse of housing prices yet We're in a housing shortage and historically mortgages are still at You know the 30 year average So let me just give you the statistics here the mortgage rate is 5.3 percent If you look at this chart from our childhood on our parents in the 80s were paying 15 16 70 17% for their mortgages. We're well below the 50 year average even with the rate hikes And so the 50 year average for mortgages the 30 year mortgage is 7.77

so we're at 5.3 well below that But well, this has been a very quick turnaround from two and a half percent mortgages all the way up to 5.3 percent Home sales have started to show weakness. So to sax's point. This is starting to show up in the numbers, but ever so much We're down six percent almost seven percent year over year and 3.5 percent month over month, but we're holding up historically. So for the last ten years We've been selling over five million homes a month with the exception of the pandemic shutdown And that's this next chart you're gonna see here and this is a really amazing chart I found which is existing home sales versus a 30 year fixed rate mortgage in our Childhoods in the 80s were some two three million homes a year as you see the rates That's the orange line come down massively from 17 percent and then under 10 percent Housing starts to flip people start flipping houses more and more often But we're still at that five million that number has got a drop down to Probably four and then we would actually have some capitulation Feedback from the panel.

I mean look, I there's an old saying that a recession is When your neighbor loses his job and a depression is when you lose your job and the reality is we haven't had the big job losses yet It's starting we can start to see it in the number of open recs are getting closed And then there were those job loss numbers that just came out which were a little higher than expected So the job losses are starting but so far it's really been the step prior to that Which is people are seeing their 401ks get destroyed stock markets down They're seeing their wages get destroyed by inflation food and gas prices being much higher So there's a really good reason why people are so sentiment is so negative out there Yeah, people feel poorer than they were before and this could get worse like you saying Jason with their nest egg in their homes getting I agree.

That's the next shoe to drop just like the commercial real estate is the next shoe to drop but I Think the really big question over the next six months is what sort of job losses do we see? Because that really is gonna be the big determinant of of how hard this recession hits Yeah, I agree with you and it's it doesn't look like if we if we're losing 300,000 jobs a month It's gonna take a long time for us to even get to one for one jobs And so this is a very just honestly I think I think you're right But I think we're not even close to that.

I just don't see Where all of a sudden there are these writ large mass layoffs for example I would believe what you're saying if the headline in the Wall Street Journal said Walmart lays off 10,000 people, right? That's not what's happening. In fact, it's the exact opposite Walmart's like well, you know, we seem to have record demand We're raising prices and and every supplier will have to pay a gas tax and a supplier tax and deal with it So I just think that you're you're going to be right in the end I just think we're way too early in this process to get to that place where we did we're debating this I don't see so Chama thought you on board with the the Ackman trade basically, you know Ackman basically came out that tweet some a couple of days ago basically saying that listen inflation is still the big problem Not recession the economy is humming along there's plenty of jobs and We're gonna have a persistent problem with inflation.

I think he's kind of right and kind of wrong I think that you can have inflation and a recession at the same time. This is one of my point is I think we have been in a supply side recession meaning The day of the pandemic, it's not as if demand stopped It's not as if you and I David didn't want to go out or use door dash or take an Uber or watch a movie in a movie theater We were not allowed, right? And so we found other ways in in order to fulfill our demand That's why Shopify, you know did so well on behalf of the merchants that they served.

That's why Robin Hood did so well That's why fortnight did so well, right? We found other places to spend money But what went away was a supply and those incentives didn't come back and they're still not back That's why prices keep going up. This is the problem is the definition of a recession, right? Chumat It's not the problem is just that most people don't understand that you can have a supply side recession and a demand side recession They just manifest in different ways. So well, I think I think I think like I guess Ackman is roughly right in some ways He's roughly not so right in some others I think that we have an issue where we are going to transfer The supply side issues that are driving inflation To average everyday consumers and their ability to buy things.

I still think that the average everyday consumers Desire to buy things is what it was from before and on the margin is probably higher. I Do think at some point it will start to change when prices get high enough But I don't think we've reached that point of equilibrium yet and the reason is because Companies like the Walmart's of the world who see this demand on literally a real time basis Knows better than anybody else when and how much they can raise prices downstream into their supply chain So when you see something like this in the Wall Street Journal, I would just encourage us all to say They must see that demand is the same or better And so they're going to now push those price increases down to everybody else because now Walmart says Here is an opportunity for me to defend my earnings power and This is why I think we're in this first inning of this So I don't know whether Ackman is right or wrong But I think we're in the early phases of a two phase recession And I don't know what that looks like because I've never lived through one of those and I think in many ways It's the combination of the two and it was it was largely because of government failure Government failure and how we reacted to the pandemic in hindsight sacks was right all along We overreacted by shutting everything down We probably could have kept some supply online by understanding masking early on and then second We exacerbated with failed government policy because we gave everybody trillions and trillions of dollars and we entered the capital markets and Perverted it with another seven or eight trillion more and by the way, that has consequences well the consequences are still talking about giving stimulus yeah now in order to Help people deal with so we are not we are not learning second You can't pour fire so if I eat on the fire if I had to basically put what we are all saying Into a neat little bow.

I would say there needs to be a multi phased economic correction One that corrects the supply that we took out of the market during the pandemic One that corrects for all the excess money and then one that corrects for demand That's a lot of stuff we have to do So the more misguided government policy we have the farther away from finding that equilibrium point We're going to be the longer it's going to take the more damage is going to be so sacks the Fed is obviously It's pretty much consensus. They're going to do another point 75 75 basis points later this month Could be 50 basis points.

Who knows there seems to be a couple of people saying that that might happen if That does happen and it feels like inflation is starting to top out. Do you think inflation? You know starts to turn or do you think we're still going to see prices go up because it does feel like it was Starting to bounce along the ceiling Where do you what do you think's going to happen if the point seven five happens? You're seeing the market rally today in the last few days Especially gross stocks because of this idea that the Fed is tackling inflation They're raising rates and the market is looking out six months as seeing the possibility of recession And they believe that is going to bring down demand and bring down prices and it could I mean what I just described would be a soft landing I just am skeptical there's gonna be a soft landing because of what you're saying which is this is a Multi part problem and until we fix the supply side, I don't think that merely reducing demand is going to get us out of this I really agree with you.

It's a production problem. It's a demand problem and It's also as we just talked about a few minutes ago an employment problem because the businesses that need to grow that need to Generate revenue cannot get the businesses that are dependent on people to do service jobs Cannot get those jobs filled and so they cannot grow their revenue cannot make their profits and there's a trickling effect in the economy Of that, you know what we talked about that kind of job shift that job market shift that's happened So all three and so all three are just this like dislocation that's happened totally right and it's unclear, you know Someone very smart.

I was talking to yesterday who's a former Member of an administration said we just there's literally no way to predict But we just don't because you think about the complexity of throwing three rocks in a pond How do those three rocks interact and how do the ripples interact is really what we're trying to predict and it's very hard to do I mean if you translate this into the markets for one second I Think what we've done since November of 21 then Nick you should play this clip because you know not to say You know we didn't see this coming, but we really did you know We pointed to you know one of our friends in the person somebody else that we kind of know Bezos and Elon and we said When the two smartest capital allocators in the world Start divesting They clearly understand and see things that the rest of us should pay attention to and to ignore it seems reckless or your clip And we'll be back in 30 seconds after the clip The two most important founders of our generation the two smartest people who have really consistently won Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have collectively sold more than 11 billion dollars of their holdings this year alone And if you can't take all of that and decide for yourself what's right for you and your family you're doing yourself a disservice I think it's important for me to never sort of like be forced to tell folks whether I'm buying or selling although I'm willing to do it in moments where I think it's important But I think it's really important to understand the context and so I think like these folks that like think Derisively about individuals who are managing risk.

I think it's really naive and I think it's It creates a lot of missed opportunity for them as well If the smartest people in the world are now selling their core holdings that they told you they would never sell and you are not Reconsidering your position on things you're either much smarter than them or you're being really really reckless And that was November, you know and at that moment I started a bunch of things in process which we can talk about at the end But I also sold the warriors position I started a process at that point and I sold a piece in December and then I just sold my the last piece this week But then you know, I sold a big piece of sofi in that moment But the the point was more the following which is since that clip to today What we've gone through is a massive Rerating of the discount factor of these companies assuming nothing else changes, right? That's all we've done We've we've not questioned whether earnings can change, you know, all we said is okay Well, now we're gonna take the discount rate up, which means the value of this company is less than it used to be That's all we've done through all of this wealth destruction that's happened since November But now the second shoe has to drop which is if you believe that after this supply side issues are resolved You go through a demand destruction phase The earnings of these companies are in real trouble and Jason you posted something I think about the social media companies and Advertising is gonna get hit right so one of the first things to go in a recession is advertising If you're gonna belt tighten at a company, where can you do it? Well, you lay off employees, but you can't get out of your leases as we talked about in real estate But you can cut your spending on marketing and so right now they it's looking pretty bleak for Facebook because of the headwinds they have so the earnings could drop which means and by the way It's not a ratio could be totally talked about.

Thanks are not real, right? Well, we talked about that we talked about that over the last few weeks Which is every time the market rallied oddly Facebook would be stagnant or trade off and we know when I called people on Wall Street What they said was because you know, we think this is the company that has the most pressure on earnings I don't know if that's true or not, but they took every opportunity and rallies to trim their position in Facebook now If that's true, you have to remind yourself that is one of the 10 best companies in the entire world And so if you're gonna go and question the earnings power of one of the 10 best companies in the world You may want to consider the earnings power of every other company.

That's not Facebook There are some unique things to the Facebook story They are facing a unique disruptive moment with Apple Ankleing their ability to target users supposedly Google might follow suit with that which would be super anti competitive and also the surging TikTok taking market share from them. There's some good news in energy Which will then dovetail into politics and into this farming situation Friedberg Turkish government claims it just discovered almost 700 million metric tons of rare earth minerals. It's 15 times China's reserve if this is true You guys probably know we use about a hundred fifty Thousand metric tons a year right now.

That's gonna double by 2030 This is something like four thousand years at the current demand and this would put them far beyond anybody else's Chimati've got investments in this space. I don't know if you've been tracking this news thoughts on Another massive discovery of rare earths. What did you guys just have dinner dinner or serve for you guys? No, that's the best she brought she brought us We show me there's an incredible restaurant here in Milan called De Santis Which makes the best paninis you've ever tasted. Is this a harbinger of the future De Santis? What could be more perfect than that? Oh This is the Oracle sax with the subliminal influence absolutely good.

This is what's gonna get us out of this situation De Santis All right, Chimati's quickly on the rare earths if this is actually true What would this do? And have you been tracking the situation because it does seem there's some truth to it Yeah, I think it's important to just take a step back and kind of look at this thing with not like complete skepticism But just a little skepticism. It's okay not surprising that there's additional deposits all around the world meaning We've always said rare earths are not particularly that rare It's just the question is you know, which of the 17 rare earth elements at what grade meaning at what percent concentration? Does it exist and then really importantly at what cost to extract it economically? Yeah, right so meaning there's a ton of underdeveloped rare earth assets in Canada the US Africa Australia Brazil Brazil They're just under under develop because when you put all of these factors together It's really tough.

So the government release says they're gonna process like 570,000 tons of ore That'll produce around 10,000 kilotons per year of rare earths that implies sort of a 1.75 to 2% grade It's fine So there's just a lot more work I would just sort of say it's really directionally great a lot more work needs to be done and more importantly They need to release enough of this detail So folks like us and others can actually diligence it to tell you more accurately, but the press release was exciting Freeberg this reminds me a little bit of the peak oil head fake.

We had you know 15 years ago Everybody basically said we're not gonna find more oil Here's what's left of oil and then Norway's like yeah We just found more oil than existed previously and it's been pulled out and the whole concept that the world's gonna run out of oil Is now gone. So freeberg what is happening in science that? We just can't predict what resources are available. We know very little about what's inside the below the a certain depth of the crust of the earth so You know there's some estimates But we're always surprised and we know very little about the distribution of those elements in the crust of the earth and below the crust of the earth You know mining's an incredible industry.

I don't know the state of the art in engineering and mining very well But you know from a pure geophysics point of view by some estimates we have 10 billion years of energy reserves below the crust of the earth that we can access in the form of nuclear reserves geothermal power And that's excluding, you know some of the you know the potential of some of these elements and what they can do In building a more sustainable energy economy is people so pessimistic when we keep surprising ourselves and resources Anyone wants a great book None of you guys were at the dinner that I did a few weeks ago where we had Steven Pinker come for dinner Yeah, read his book Enlightenment now It could watch one of his videos on YouTube where he's got like all 60 slides And he highlights like you know humans have a tendency to focus on the risks and the concerns in the downsides and we miss the incredible optimism That is apparent as we actually look at the data of what's happening with our species and what we're doing on our planet We have every reason to be optimistic, you know, we have fewer wars than we've ever had Murder rate per capita as low as it's ever been Longevity is increasing help is increasing per capita Everything everything's increasing and I think that the same is true in terms of you know scientific breakthroughs discovery and engineering our way To a more sustainable energy and food future This is one of the great things about having you as a friend freeberg is your relentless optimism and your actual cool comp collective lack of anxiety In other amazing news for me the EU Parliament has flipped again Credit Thurmburg is completely tilted.

We talked about the virtue signaling EU Parliament, you know and Germany turning off their nuclear power plants and and just securing the bag for Putin the EU Parliament flipped and they are now saying these Virtue signaling knuckleheads they came to the census and now they believe nuclear is green Also green according to the EU Parliament is natural gas So this to me feels like the beginning of the end for Putin and Saudi Arabia If you look at the US becoming a net exporter of energy It's quite possible the EU could become that as well if they actually and this is a big if if they actually You know start building nuclear It could be the beginning of the end of what some people are calling the woke green movement and That's certainly over this realization that to transition to the next car to the beyond the carbon economy Is going to require continuing to invest in and support the carbon economy Until those alternative solutions emerge and to have to dual track investing And I think that that's what we're seeing around the world in the United States in Europe now and Europe has always been farther away Farther left in the United States in taking this point of view and I think now this this has been a wake up call for everyone And all it took was just a little bit of six dollar gasoline and for people to personally suffer For them to change their virtue signaling nonsense.

Yeah, this is this is markets at work Yeah, this is simply educate in the public. Would you rather be beholden to Putin? They pivoted because you rather have nukes they pivoted from banning energy production to banning food production She's talking about another one about to get there about to get so on the energy side I did a in the group chat just a little breakdown on the math. I think it may be interesting for people to understand But today globally around the world Every single country in the world That is involved in the oil business is able to produce exactly one million more barrels per day Then we need so let's assume that we you know need a hundred million barrels of oil a day as a as a as a world To continue to do everything we want to do we produce 101 million so we're right on the knife's edge By August we're gonna go through a capacity increase in OPEC plus Which is you know OPEC plus Russia and etc Saudi Arabia is gonna go from 10 million barrels a day to 11 million barrels.

So not a huge increase Russia has is is thought to be able to cut production if they feel pressure Up to 5 million barrels a day without having any impact to their economy so JP Morgan I think and Credit Suisse they they did this sensitivity analysis and here's what they found They found that if Russia were to cut 3 million barrels of oil So we would go from being oversupplied by 1 million to undersupplied by 2 The price of oil would go to about 180 dollars a barrel If they cut 5 million so the threshold at which their economy doesn't really get that impacted The price of oil could go as high as 380 dollars a barrel While you would say okay Well, we just need to pump more oil from other places and this is the problem in all of these rules that have existed for so long The capacity doesn't exist right? We were destroying supply Governments all around the world were making it very difficult to generate the supply of nuclear To generate the supply of oil and to generate the supply of Nat gas so Saudi Arabia says we can get to 12 million Well, guess what they can only start the work in 2024 They'll be done in 2027 Yeah, so to your point all of a sudden we realized wait we needed these bridge fuels all along Yeah, how do we allow all of this supply destruction to happen and now we need to unwind it? It's gonna be a very complicated process and if any of these things happen if Russia decides to play hardball against Europe or America we better hope that it's a mild winter because very quickly you can go from plus 1 million barrels to minus 2 in a Harpy yeah, and American start and the last point on this Saudi Arabia you'd say okay Well Saudi Arabia is gonna go from 10 to 11 so that's good They have been at 11 million for some total of eight weeks in their entire lifetime if we look at this I mean Americans also buying 20 to 25 mile per gallon cars.

That's got to end too. And so personal responsibility Is part of this the really interesting thing is China already has this plan Their nuclear strategy with the Belt and Road initiative is to put 30 nuclear reactors in countries outside of China that they're trying to have influence in and they're that's building 30 nukes right now They got 150 planned so China's just ultimately savvy and thinking big here about energy independence and we need to follow them other big anybody have anything else on the energy situation before we go to The farming situation Let's get to the farming situation.

Okay, so Dutch farmers are in revolt After a new proposed law to cut emissions On Tuesday Dutch lawmakers voted on proposals to slash emissions of pollutants like nitrogen oxide and ammonia They're targeting at 50% cut nationwide by 2030 Livestock produces these emissions so the plan will likely force Dutch farmers to cut their livestock herds or stop working all together Farmers protested They put their tractors outside buildings. They dump fertilizer 40,000 farmers gathered last week in the central Netherlands agricultural heartland to protest these plans And this cause shooting at them They got these tractors were doing some pretty gnarly things and stopping traffic and And Were they no wait the government there was the protesters were unarmed As far as what I'm armed, but supposedly they were doing some dangerous Were they honking their horns? No, no, please to shoot working class threatening the safety of This is the other side of the story sacks Listen either was were there but according to the sources They were using the tractors to threaten the police like physical bodily harm and that's why they unloaded We don't know all the details.

It'll come out, but that sounds fortunate. I Mean if you had a tractor coming at you to kill you and you're a police officer I think it is a pretty slow load. Let me just talk about the science of its science. Yeah, let's go Wait, is it like the scene in Austin Powers where there's a steamroller coming towards? Jason's like, oh, they're using the tractors a weapon. That's like really just I'm I was I was not telling you what was reporting reporting what's reported and nobody knows if those reports are true So I think look I think it's worth just highlighting because this is a really important This is the first time we've seen Government action of this scale and and the resulting kind of rebound effect on something that's really important Humans use roughly between two and six percent of our energy on earth every year to make ammonia Ammonia is the primary fertilizer we use to fertilize our crops around the world And if not for the invention of the Haberbosch process Which you can read about in the book the alchemy of air and the creation of ammonia as a synthetic fertilizer Humans would all have starved in the mid 20th century.

It's an incredible technology breakthrough What we've learned over the years, however, is that when ammonia sits on the ground for too long It volatilizes and it basically binds with oxygen and turns into nitrous oxide and goes into the atmosphere nitrous oxide is 300 times More potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2 it lasts longer and it absorbs more heat So there has long been concerned about the overuse of fertilizer in the overproduction of ammonia That just sits on the ground for too long that ultimately creates this incredible greenhouse gas effect And so there has been talk in the United States under the Obama administration under multiple EPAs There was a Supreme Court ruling a few weeks ago that started to touch on whether or not the EPA has regulatory authority here To actually regulate the use of ammonia Farmers generally put a lot of ammonia on the ground because they get higher yields out of their crop The problem is if that ammonia sits there for too long it turns into a greenhouse gas And so regulating ammonia and regulating this nitrous oxide emission has been you know at the forefront of green the green movement at the forefront of Climate change as one of the ways to manage and reduce the effects of global warming from human industry And now you know the Dutch government has come out and started to do some of this regulation It's a little bit off because it comes from cows and and we're seeing what happens Chimoth free brick Can we finally admit that it's the vegans fault now? Well at this point actually? You know No, the ammonia production in the Netherlands is from the I mean it's just you guys know the Netherlands is the world's third largest dairy exporter They export three billion dollars a year of dare of milk to the rest of the world other countries And so they have all these cows that are like densely packed and they're peeing everywhere and that pee is ammonia And it's causing all of this problems the other problem with ammonia So if you guys look at the United States corn farmers farm in the Midwest When it rains the ammonia on their fields goes into the streams goes into the Mississippi River and goes into the Gulf of Mexico in the Gulf of Mexico.

There is a massive Hypoxic zone there are no fish they're all dead because when ammonia ends up in the water it kills life And so there's this green algae and no fish and everything dies And so that's what the Dutch are trying to regulate and the EU generally been trying to regulate is the removal of excess ammonia in Ag production and in Again, I still hear though that if if we ate less vegetables, this wouldn't be a problem Not correct not correct most of the production of ammonia is used to make animal feed Which is used to feed animals to make beef, which is a terrible decision You could feed it olives as we know olives taste delicious Is the issue here that the Regulators hit the brakes too hard on these farmers and they should have maybe had a more gradual Landings for them is it's been talked about for a long time and in the US There's just no way a law is gonna pass because the US Senate is controlled primarily by rural states Which are ag heavy so you see a lot of you don't see a lot of bills that hurt farmers get passed in the United States Because the Senate is controlled by farmers that are elect or sorry senators that are elected by farmer by big farming communities and farming states and So, you know, it's been hard to get a regulation like this past where folks have tried to and talked about doing it Around the world, however, and a place like the Netherlands and the EU or as I mentioned before they're far more progressive And have this very kind of green hat on they're starting to take this sort of climate change action as they're calling it and that climate change action You know does have the ramifications of destroying by the way One of the things they said is we expect and this will destroy the livelihoods of many dairy farmers in the Netherlands That was horrible.

By the way, look all kidding aside They said that directly by the way and the dairy farmers are like if you you're not destroying our business for climate change I have a specific question though, which is has there not been some efforts to engineer How these plants themselves absorb nitrogen? That's great. I have three businesses. That's a totally right technology is gonna solve this problem I'm super optimistic on that. There are microbes that are being used to coat seed Those microbes can pull nitrogen out of the atmosphere directly. So you don't need ammonia So you use far less ammonia.

There's a couple companies that are doing this really effectively. They're growing like crazy They're doing really well There are other projects and there's very simple solutions my last company We had a product called nitrogen advisor where we basically told farmers instead of dumping all the fertilizer at the start of the season You paste it out so the fertilizer doesn't sit there and volatilize There's all these solutions that technology allows from software to bioengineering to these microbial solutions And so we're definitely I think gonna resolve this but meanwhile these governments are in a frenzy to solve the climate change problem and You know, they're gonna start to pass these laws that really hurt the livelihoods of you know, ag producers How do you guys think something like this happens because? Typically you would expect when a government is about to pass something like this There's sort of like a pretty fulsome review and all sides are brought together and there's working groups and all of this stuff And at some point you would talk to some scientists at other points You would talk to economists at other points you talk to the people who'd be directly affected like the farmers Is it that the virtue signaling around sustainability and climate change is just so high? That people just turn off their brains or well like what is actually happening here? I think what's going on is you got a bunch of technocratic bureaucrats in Brussels who don't know anything about farming or these people who live in the Netherlands who've been doing this for generations and They sit there in Brussels and they make up these completely arbitrary Guidelines and requirements 50% by 2030 those are suspiciously round numbers.

Okay, and then some other You know authoritarian technocrat in the Netherlands then says well We got to implement this and they pass some crazy law and they don't even think about the impact on these farmers Why because they're deplorables. I mean, it's complete class bias. It's just like the Canadian truckers They don't think about these people. They don't factor into their equation. They don't know how they live and And so that's what's going on here And so you've got this global elite of Technocrats who are willing to use authoritarian tactics. They're appropriating their farms are taking them away That's why they're up in arms.

See the rest of it what you're not saying. It's not just technocrats It's the actual global elite writ large have wrapped themselves around this sustainability blanket And they believe that that word Justifies all kinds of bad unscientific enumerate policies, right? And by the way, they're they've just woken up on energy, right? They they had just banned energy production in Europe They realized oh wait a second. This is making us dependent on Russia and authoritarians. Well, what is the other big export of Ukraine? It's food so they got smart on energy and now they're about to repeat their same dumb mistake of Basically prohibiting this area where they have an enormous natural advantage, which is food production So, you know, it's like they just keep making the same mistake over and over again And by the way, let me ask you a question the way.

Yeah, look I'm not gonna question you on the science free bird But here's what I would say is I think there's a tendency on the part of these technocrats to think that the science is A lot more bulletproof than it actually is that is certainly what we saw with COVID is we had these same sort of global Elitists these technocrats who claim to be health experts They made up all these lockdown rules that we talked about the beginning of the show No, no, this is inspeculable. But what I will I will They're willing to use they're willing to use heavy handed authoritarian tactics And I just don't believe that the science of this especially this 50% by 2030 Why is that the guideline who can prove that those are the exact right numbers and they're willing to use any tactics necessary To implement their crazy rules.

Let me ask you a question sacks Let's assume that there's a technology transition possible that there are solutions that could be used I highlighted a few of them. They just cost money. They require some investment and You know creating this distortion in the market by saying you can't release 50% of the ammonia that you've been releasing Forces a technological shift that otherwise would have taken longer in the market Do you agree that there may be a scenario here whereby, you know, governments can and should intervene and I'm not making the case personally I'm just trying to you know highlight for you that I think this is where folks are coming from There are alternative ways to make the dairy.

They're alternative ways to feed the cows there All or you know, well, here's where I think you're going with that which could make sense Which is okay, you're saying there is a pollution externality here being created by the farmers Well, it's a basically internalized the externality. We need to capture the cost of that So what you could do is gradually introduce some sort of permit system, you know or A tradeable permit system right where that would incentivize the creation of these technologies that you're talking about You want to do it gradually so you don't destroy the livelihoods of these farmers who've been doing it for generations So that would probably be the approach you'd want to take I think that I think that is what is going to happen around the world is that that sort of cap and trade or taxation system It's going to get slowly rolled out for a lot of these externality costs in production in industry and agriculture Particularly because there are technological alternatives and it will incentivize the switch to those alternatives Because the alternatives will cost less than the taxes sacks based on what you're saying is one of the problems here that these technocrats These professional politicians, they don't actually have great strategic thoughtful You know real world experience to do planning You know looking at Germany their inability to see the writing on the wall of what? Building a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany and shutting down nukes would do it just seems like over and over They're just really bad strategic thinkers Combined with this No Jason they are influenced by these cultural elites who they want to carry favor group think it's a lot of group Yeah behind the group think is a class bias right they only associate with other members of the professional class who have you know basically graduate degrees They don't even interact with these farmers just like the just like the legislators making COVID rules the health experts never interact with Canadian truckers So there's a huge amount of class prejudice saying that these people just don't matter We can force them to obey our rules and if they don't like it will confiscate their farms and by the way the rest of you you're gonna have to learn to eat bugs or tofu or Tempe or a cycle excrement or whatever.

How is the DeSantis? Well, what's your DeSantis was the DeSantis? Brutal what did you have on there was a some what's a rail? I have roast beef as a beautiful roast beef beautiful roast beef by the sentence Brought to you by the sentence. It's gonna become a meme after this episode. I had a shooter. Oh, is the best market campaign ever He's a lock for president. Jekyll. I had prosciutto cut though with Bree white truffle cream and lemon I mean did you have the white truffle on it? That's like a plus. What's that bro? This is a year old euros.

No, it's like eight euros Eight euros. Yeah, bring some back bring some back. Wait, I want to say something about this I hope the Democrats Embrace this agenda wholeheartedly because if we get all the voters who want to eat roast beef I'm pretty sure that's a super majority in this country The way to solve this freeberg is with the right economic incentives There's no reason why the Dutch government had to go and basically put Thousands of farmers out of business instead what they could have done is actually created the tax incentive that allowed farmers to adopt Some of these bleeding edge technologies when they were probably too expensive to make it Economically equivalent that I mean by the way that is not a new fangled idea.

This is not genius talk here Yeah, so the reason why they don't do the obvious simple thing is class bias It is exactly what David said it is the influence of people it's who look hold on Who look down on these people? Yeah, okay, and who believe that they are? More virtuous because of their desire to defend climate change. There's also a pragmatic piece of this This reminds me the cold debates we had there are 62,000 coal miners in this country Like this is a small number of people who were impacted we could just you know, basically give them Severance or in a soft landing instead of the you know this crazy or or let them continue to do their job and egress off Naturally the economic free market have a manning it will manage it on its own and instead what you could do is actually green light nuclear Subsidize some of these more ventures ways in which you can extract and refine LNG But my point is this is where it's a real head scratch or why politicians don't do this And I think the only thing that I can come up with is that they are Overly influenced by these cultural elites with their perspectives.

I agree that do You judge very harshly what they believe to be right and what they believe to be wrong Can we take a victory lap here in the United States that we're energy independent and that we're food independent? Can we take that victory? How much longer Jason? No, well, I think we now need to think instead of just being independent I think our mission should be surplus Jason our president, you know, cancel the Keystone Pipeline He canceled a bunch of exploration permits in the Gulf, you know, again, it's we are one bad winter away From all of a sudden being in the same situation as everybody else.

So it's not as One bad. We're not one free Berg. Where are we in terms of our independence? J. Cal we are the number one ag exporter in the world and by the way under a different president just a couple years ago We were the number one energy exporter in the world The fact that we take a victory comes to food and energy We have the greatest natural resources and we should be developing that we should be moving But no sacks my point is what if the United States took a philosophy of not just being independent but being even like a stronger surplus to the point of like Building new we are we're working it out the markets working it out and we're taking you know We're we just need to feels like we could do better It feels like we do the issue with nuclear power as you know is the regulatory cost So, you know, it's ten billion dollars and thirty years to get it.

Let's move to the lightning round We already know I just want to show you guys the Monmouth poll which I think is worth highlighting Okay, we didn't talk about it, but the Monmouth poll that was published a few days ago Which is the June 2022 poll the number one concern that America the number one thing Americans are concerned about Nick You could put the chart the table in the in the show notes 33% care about inflation 15% care about gas prices 9% care about the economy 6% care about everyday bills and groceries, you know, you add that up That's the vast majority of what people are concerned about and all the way down at the bottom of the table is climate change at 1% Yeah, absolutely.

So I think it just speaks to the point about, you know, there there is and by the way I'm not advocating that this is the right position But I will say that there is a huge distinction or discrepancy between what the average American is worried about and You know where political leaders are trying to carry us forward. I'm not sure what the right answer is But there's definitely a disconnect and I think it's it's being played out in this Netherlands situation right now One point for you on that as well Nick. I put this article in the in the chat but the the top ESG fund manager in Europe of the of 2022 they released their Results and the guy was up like almost 16% And he disclosed what he owns and he turns out that he owns Conoco Valero and Exxon and According to the ESG rules that these folks have passed this qualifies as an ESG fund because he doesn't own weapons porn and oil sense But it allows all these people to walk around thinking that their investments are tied up in things that are actually clean It's not true.

So the point is that there are there are these structural lies that have been baked into the system That they are supported by very shoddy accounting or rules or science and if we're really gonna fix this problem I think you have to go and inspect these things and call them out But like all of this ESG investing which perpetuates by the way perhaps, you know why these governments just have no clue What's going on sit on top of all of these lies? There's nothing ESG about Conoco and Exxon per se. Let's just call it for what it is This guy's a good fund manager.

It's a he's a good fund manager He did well in a movie in a period where everybody else was down Let's just celebrate that and not tell all these it had a good marketing spin for a while So, you know, but it's not just marketing it allows people to believe that there's a solution that is being affected That is not true. That's the heart about it. That is super nefarious Yeah, okay, listen, we move science up because science got a short shrift last week. What is a lightning round? What is that? I just wanted to things that were small that weren't like full segments I my concept here was to just put things at the end of the show that we missed but what I did Give you a shout out.

You're doing a great job moderating today by the way. Thank you Put a couple extra hours in by the way I think freeberg made a really interesting point a minute ago about me being a great moderator. No, not that okay about the About the polling the mom of polling where if you look at what voters care about and what the elites and the elected politicians care about there's a huge divergence You know, that's clearly what happened in Holland, right? You got these Dutch farmers They're lively. It's a big takeaway about people in Brussels who don't even understand what they do I mean, you want to make a living? Yeah, but but this is why you're seeing populist nationalist Uprising's in all these countries is you've got a crowd of people who go to Davos and make policy and they're completely Disconnected they're completely disconnected from the real concern.

Look at Bojo. I'm a electorate Bojo just got booted today Why? Ultimately at the root cause as he was throwing COVID parties when he was telling the same thing that everybody nailed Gavin Newsom for This guy just got booted out as Prime Minister They're hypocrites and they're incompetent at their jobs. Let's call it what it is The association is you try and do what you believe to be best for everyone, but it's not it's not what's best for you You know, and I think that that's the point like climate fixing climate change stopping COVID I got to do X Y and Z for everyone But I still want to fly in a private jet and I still want to go to a COVID party, you know to a dinner party exactly a super spread This is why I think Biden is very unpopular.

I mean look he's Tea up It's a lot easier if I do that It's I have a good joke just let me do all right, so all of the Friedberg stands were breaking my chops that C'moth was cackling and laughing during a science segment and we rushed him so I moved science up So to the Friedberg stands, please stand down now We go to Biden derangement syndrome segment at the end of the show Joe Biden's cognitive decline is becoming the topic Sacks have at it. Well, listen if if you call this Biden derangement syndrome 62% of the country has Biden derangement because we all did for Trump Biden's poll numbers are down to something like 38% It's historic low for this point in time of a presidency But look what the point I was trying to make was I think that Biden's problems flow from this dynamic We're talking about which is he campaigned as Scranton Joe He was a working class hero who is going to give us a return to normalcy and what has he done? He's basically implemented every wacky idea of the progressive left.

He basically is representing that part of the party That is completely disconnected from the ordinary desires of the working class And what are people concerned about right now food and energy prices? What is biden concerned? Well, first of all, he's blaming it on mom and pop gas stations even Even jeff bezos had to that tweet was insane. Yeah, so just to queue up the tweet my message This is biden sweet my message to the companies running gas stations and selling and setting Prices at the pump is simple. This is a time of war and global peril Bring down the price that price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you're paying for the product and do it now And then almost all small business franchises Which is absurd and that's just not how the economy works Do you think that they look at a chevron and think it's owned by chevron or they cannot be who's tweeting for Well, some some millennial some millennial with a couple of masters degrees And and 400,000 of dead is rage tweeting from the lighthouse strategy to make him look incompetent I mean, I am forever.

Thanks for joe biden to getting trump out before he took a third or fourth It would take an eight second google search to know that less than 10 percent of The gas stations in america are owned by these corporates. Well, here's bezos is queasy. These are mom and pop businesses This is insanity. It's a lot of immigrants. It's a lot of south asians. This is why it's very sensitive to me These gas stations they are mom and pop owned a lot of them are owned by immigrants and this is their small It's very strange of the american dream and biden comes along and he's saying you're doing too well I mean these people their profit margins like two percent two percent two percent nothing My buddy's family by the way owns a bunch of gas stations in the bay area And he told me they make no money on gas.

They make all their money selling cigarettes and soda. That's it. That's the whole business Yeah, it's a way to get people into a convenience store. Here's my thought I think I'm gonna state it right here bezos is gonna run for president in 2024. This is why he retired What this is why he's giving money away. I will bet anything against though. Okay. I listen to you Give me odds. He doesn't need that. He doesn't need the headache. 15 to 1. Okay. Well, you see I think he's playing legacy games Look, he's playing legacy games. No.

Why else would he become a shit poster on twitter? Ouch inflation is far too important. That wasn't even a shitpost. Well, anyway, he's he's bezos after dark You don't have to run a company anymore He's bezos after dark. That wasn't even a shitpost. That was kind of like he was outraged by the financial illiteracy the sheer financial stupidity And you know, the economic what is the lack of economic understanding take on the president? There's no upside there. He's starting a fight Jekyll it's just calling out something that on its face that tweet It was not written by joe biden So let's not pin the blame on him But that office and that strategy is clearly broken because it is run by someone at a minimum Who's enumerate and who's clearly financially illiterate who doesn't know how to google anything because that's the only way you could write something that Insipid biden should fire whoever it is that wrote that hundred percent biden is looking for scapegoats Okay, his popularity is at historic lows like the right track wrong track numbers are at historic lows he's looking for anyone to blame and he's been going through a whole sequence and The the putin tricycle wasn't working.

He couldn't even say it right. So now they're looking for anyone else Remember elizabeth warren did something similar when they had Food inflation they started blaming the meat the meatpacking industry or whatever look This is not how these industries work But they are looking for someone to blame for their own mismanagement of the economy and biden baked this cake last year We've discussed this before he canceled energy independence his first day in office And then moreover look on this ukraine situation if you knew you're going to take this tough with putin approach Jason that I know you support okay, but if you knew a proxy war was coming or you're willing to let one happen You would want to basically create an energy glut not an energy shortage You would want to basically maximize the amount of american production and you would not want to alienate the saudis So what is biden doing now? He's going over Saudi Arabia had in hand totally humiliating to beg for forgiveness For last year ostracizing them and calling them pariahs So let me read this yeah, no hold on a second They had no grand strategy if they wanted to pursue a tough on russia strategy They should have maximized energy production instead.

They didn't even think about it. They didn't even think about it We've got energy inflation I agree with you there. It also I will say is notable. I think the democrats are actually now um I think they're quietly pushing the joe biden cognitive decline so that they can put it they can feel the What do you mean quietly? How do you allow a governor a sitting governor to run ads in a different state against the the presumed uh republican nominee unless it's ordained Well, I'm saying the cognitive decline thing. I think they're obviously not gonna come out and so jason.

I don't think this is happening surreptitiously Okay, here's the tweet from bezos. Just so people hear it ouch inflation is far too important a problem for The white house to keep making statements like this. It's either straight ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market dynamics This is a very strong statement and the point I was trying to make before is Why would bezos? Why would bezos at this time? Why would he? Take on the administration. Why would you think it's important for biden to take control of his communication strategy? And to reclaim more of the center going into the midterms.

I think a lot of this content The naming the shaming the blaming Tends to be more of the playbook from the far progressive left And I think that there's probably too many people that have infiltrated the white house from those ranks And I think he needs to close ranks a little bit more And so uh, I don't think he wrote this Okay, and I don't think he would have wrote it if he was given a chance So it's clearly something is breaking between what is being discussed as a team and then what is being executed on the ground Sacks look biden staff the wrong claims been with him for years.

They reflect his desires I think this is classic biden if you look at his career in the senate He is a grandstander. He always liked to basically scapegoat and demonize this is this is a playbook He may not have written the tweet, but he certainly endorsed it and he's given speeches now Where he's calling out this scapegoat and that scapegoat for basically the energy prices, which are totally his fault He could add a better strategy around this Santas versus Bezos you heard of your first on the Bezos thing Hold on a second. Jason, you're not taking into account.

This is actually the second time that Bezos has tweeted about inflation I'm taking that into account. Yeah. Okay. That was back in may. He called out the administration So yes, it's on this particular issue I think he feels strongly about this issue and I think he's looking at What the administration is doing and just saying this is a level of political stupidity And financial literacy that I just cannot stand and by the way, who is Jeff Bezos? Bezos is a very liberal guy He's an outspoken critic of Trump and he owns a very liberal media house at the Washington Post So I think this is a reflection that biden has even lost The Jeff Bezos of the world and he's trying to spin it as a good thing as if we don't need these billionaires But if you're losing Jeff Bezos, you're losing a lot of people in the center probably the entire I would follow the breadcrumbs He bought the Washington Post.

He bought the largest house in DC and now he's taking on the administration I think it's a clear path that he wants to run You can you can you can add mention me on twitter if you disagree. I'll tell you a funny story to end After after the sale of the warriors completed and I tweeted this thing out Uh, it was really beautiful Uh, Dray sent a beautiful text to me. Um, so did David Lee Uh, and then I got one text message from Phil Helmuth saying I dispute how much credit you've given me I expected more Wow So seven seconds to fill again, it only took seven seconds and then he called And then he called I showed I showed sacks the text right.

It's it's an unbelievable text right sacks can sacks can testify to it Did he jump the bet? He lost his mind again. He lost his mind. He said basically like, you know He took the credit that I gave him and wanted to throw it out the window He thought I really tried to fuck him over and then he said I I'm gonna block you for a week But then changed his mind I'll just tell him you'll buy him in to the to the big game or something and he'll be fine No, he didn't want money.

He just wanted more credit more credit. I know but you want to more credit him? tell him you'll stake him Because he did he did introduce you to the deal Yeah, is it true? Hold on. Is it true? Is it true that he that Phil Helmuth introduced you to the deal? Yes or no He introduced me to Joe Laker got it. So if not for Phil you probably would not have made that trade I don't know. It's not clear because they had maybe they had no they had bankers and I was you know I was using Allen and company.

So I mean do you There's not a lot of people running around in that moment trying to write a 10% 10% you because he deserved any credit for you buying your stake in the Warriors In fact, and I thought I gave him an appropriate amount of credit. Yeah, Jamath tweet stormed. It was like it was Phil Peter teal and like one other oh and then lake up lake up. Yeah, and it's like better company He couldn't find himself in like it's the best he's ever been Except when he was with Michael Jordan in jz, but other than that this was the best Phil's ever done I mean, you know when I get did you see he made it to the second When I get my fourth ring, I'm going to take a picture like Michael with the four rings, but But Jamath in the interest of peace, maybe you should just think uh, Phil right now Oh, I have a great idea to tell Phil freeberg.

Look at freebergs laughing. He's the only one that got that joke Did you get that joke? I was wondering if I should tell you to cut it or not? I don't know. I think it's good Here's a great one. You know how you don't cut that part. I think it's a funny joke You know how Phil gives his bracelets away? as like a recognition You don't have to do this but pretend that you're giving since you have four rings That you wanted to thank the other three besties on the show and that you're keeping one ring for yourself Oh my god, giving us the other three rings.

Oh my god As a thank you for all the support we've given you all the support for the warriors Yeah, for the warriors that we gave you and all the counsel we gave you over the years This will put him on mega that he should have gotten one of the four rings Super super. It's the greatest april Actually that reminds me Phil's next ring is going to me so I can't say anything critical No bracelet. Yeah bracelet. This next bracelet is going to me. So I gotta I can't say anything critical You know what you're gonna do? You take that bracelet? Whatever I said, the critical I guarantee you Saks takes the bracelet And loses it in the first three days and never wears it.

It doesn't care. Totally. Totally. Right in the garbage It doesn't care. Never talks about it again. All right, everybody. We're back. The team is playing Professional crisp ball again point. God is back. We'll see you on episode 87. We're gonna make it to 100 I feel like we can make it to 100.

He's a contract He's an asshole last time I hung out live with him. He had an IV hooked up and he was recovering from the night before Saks on an IV based basically on an IV now. That's how bad it's gotten for him Saks you look terrible. Can you please get some sun and just maybe eat one less sandwich? He's losing weight. Did you look good? I had two No, but you could afford to you're in great shape.
