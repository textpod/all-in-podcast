My name is David Sax and I have a broomstick in my b***** That is why my voice is so deep I have never had friends in my life Somebody be my friend who I don't pay What a mood we're in today, huh? What a vibe Hey everybody, hey everybody, welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast with us today, the rotating cast of characters that you've come to know and love and follow on the Twitter, the Queen of Kinwa, David Friedberg is here and the Rain Man, David Sax calling in from one remote location that is undisclosed and the dictator, Chamath Palihapatiya with us again Gentlemen, how's everybody doing? I'm punchy You're punchy? I'm punchy Chamath isn't in a mood Is he in a mood? I'm in a mood What's happening, Chamath? Nothing, I just finished a workout so I think I'm high on endorphins How much money did you lose in the market today? Wow, that's come in at just a flagrant foul of the first play of the game No, he said he wasn't happy so I was just hypothesizing No, I'm happy, I'm happy I'm about to go on Easter vacation so I'm happy about that Have you been expecting Jesus? No, I mean can I just tell you, March 2nd or whatever that day was was an absolutely ludicrous day We've kind of clotted all back We're doing pretty decently for the year again and but I got to say, my gosh, like I've really learned to deal with drawdowns in the last 30 days It's been an amazing learning process, I'm a better person for it You did look pretty shell shocked that episode Dude, I mean, I lost more money than I ever thought I would make I could bail out a small country, you know And it just vanished, it just evaporated in a day It was incredible, then it came back and then came back That's okay Well, what do we think is happening in the markets right now in terms of retail investor participation and the number of SPACs that are coming into the market I saw a statistic today that in Q1 there were 245 SPACs raised in Q1 or 250, that's on top of the 250 that were raised last year More capital was raised in Q1 than 2020, 2019 and 2018 combined in SPACs Just in Q1 Just to put some further color on this You had all these folks raise money You had some really questionable sponsors to be completely honest with you I'm not going to call any of these guys out because I don't want to give them any airtime But you literally had people who ran companies into the ground People who were kicked out of their companies for sexual impropriety It didn't matter, any random dog and cat was able to raise a SPAC in Q1 And now on the back end, you're going to start seeing some real difficulties So deals are getting retraded constantly Which means that IPOs that should have been done at price X SPACs is getting discounted by 20 and 30% to get the deal done There are all kinds of side deals getting cut left and right And this is just the beginning And the reason is because that free per coverage is a 265 There was about 110 billion raised in Q1 But how many deals? 260 deals? 298 Yeah, almost 300 So those 300 248 in 2020 So we're still in the first inning, right? If you think about it, these SPACs have two years to put the money to work So we're only max 90 days in to a two year shot clock A 700 day shot clock And so you're going to see some really crazy behavior I predict in November of 2022 Like the last six months leading into the expiration of all these SPACs in between now And then I think the market is really going to hold people accountable So like when we see a pipe opportunity now We're incredibly firm unlike Halas and the 2025 projections We're going to back off of those We want to see 2023 numbers We're going to price it to that We're going to price it with a margin of safety And so these people come back and re cut the deals constantly You know, there's a situation where this one deal retreated three times before a price cut Done And it was ended up being 35, 40% below where they started I sent Chamath a note I got this morning from my friend who works at one of the banks And one of the bulge brackets and they said there was like 50 pipes in the market last week And they think only five of them are going to get done 50 and like, you know, Chamath what like a quarter or two ago Like 100% were getting done or 80% were getting done, right? I mean Yeah, and and I'll quite honestly they were meaningfully over subscribed And now we're demanding the people that look at these pipes I'm one of them, but So I've talked to some other people who do it and we're all in the same situation because we're demanding Much better terms And so it's gonna it's gonna the pressure is gonna come on Not the founders and the companies But it's gonna come on the sponsors because I think sponsors will really have to put up a lot of their money to get these deals done And that's where you're gonna separate the weed from the chaff because most of these sponsors are doing it for a quick buck And you'll see without debating who you think it is When you see people unable to post the money to get a deal done and that deal go away that is The charlatan, right? Right.

Chamath it seems like there's also a D leveraging happening with the funds that bought a lot of these SPACs and DSPAC listings In the aftermarket, right? Which kind of creates a bit of a log jam on the back end for a lot of these So, you know, it's for those that are interested in some of these market dynamics one thing that I have learned in the last little while is that Depending on your who you are risk is managed really differently So for example, like there's there's a friend gave me this language and I'm going to repeat it because I think the way he said it Was very elegant.

There's what's called inception to date risk And then there's year to date risk. So what is the difference if you're a hedge fund? You're really in the year to date business meaning How am I doing in this current moment in time because your compensation is driven from that? And so you're very much forced to manage short term volatility in your portfolio and a lot of it is very parametric when you know, something goes down by x percent Then you have to sell and then if something goes down by y percent you sell more and if something goes by down by you know Z percent you have to shut the position out and those are extremely codified and so when you have a lot of hedge funds who are parametrically running year to date risk and You have, you know, all of a sudden, you know, the threat of inflation bond yields go up Factor rotation out of tech.

It's a running to the exits Then you have other people who manage what's called inception to date risk Um, I would say Buffett is in that category, you know for us for the most part We are inception to date risk because we don't have external appease And so you can manage these different risk buckets differently But you have to appreciate that a lot of this volatility is a lot of year to date risk now then you layer on top of it these exogenous events like what happened this week with archegos and And it's just absolutely incredible because it just further amplifies All these people who would otherwise have made very rational decisions may force to make irrational year to date risk management decisions And that's what causes these massive swings and all this malaise in the market Sacks, what are we seeing on in private company? evaluations, I know that while we're seeing the retreat in Inchamott's part of the world and people buckling down and maybe some more guardrails if we will or maybe a tighter Screening process for these companies going public.

You didn't say fisk or chumoth But that was the one that had me like what fisk or didn't they fail twice already? What are you seeing on the private market sex? Yeah, it's a very frothy time to be honest. I think valuation levels are I mean, they're probably the highest I've seen I'm seeing seed deals now hot seed deals not every seed deal get done in the high 20s Same Yeah, exactly. It used to be yeah pre revenue It used to be that like, you know, I remember when you know pre revenue seed deals were more like a five to ten cap And then like that a little bit of revenue might be a 15 cap and like the hottest company out of yc Just explain what that means sacks The hottest company out of Caps when you say cap is this evaluation.

It's a 15 million dollar valuation effectively It's just on a convertible note called a safe. So it's but for all practical purposes, it's evaluation So it used to be you know Pre revenue seed deals used to be in the five to ten Million dollar valuation range then, you know, a little bit of revenue be 15 the hottest yc deal might be an 18 to 20 million dollar valuation Now we're seeing hot pre revenue seed deals going for like 27 to 30 And what percent what amount of capital is going into that round? It's usually like a 10 to 20 percent dilution event.

So it's three million to six million. Yeah, exactly And they're not calling this the series a they're still going to see the seed round It's the first money in the company. So it's still a seed and I mean just we also do obviously a and b and And increasingly some growth investments everything the price levels are basically double Where they were just I would say like a year ago, you know, these same seed deals Same thing I'm seeing and it's making me think As a private market investor that maybe the right thing to do is to stop investing in some as many new companies And work with the existing portfolio to raise capital.

So I told my team, let's go through the portfolio Let's see who needs capital and let's help them shore up their balance sheet when the market's hot And valuations are high as opposed to going and trying to get into every deal. So I think I'm going to do maybe 30% less deals and redeploy my time at getting the current portfolio cashed up and it's working What do you think of this strategy? Chamath or sacks or Friedberg? I personally like it. I think that Venture investors are typically trained. I was trained this way early on Which is to invest through the cycle right just to think about this as a constant pattern of Capital and to be honest with you I have issues with doing that Jason and And so I more agree with what you're saying, which is that I think like active risk management Especially I guess if it's your own capital, but I just think active risk management is important.

It's important to acknowledge that The incremental SaaS company may not be that great as it is And so at 30 pre maybe really stretching the bounds of reality Whereas to your point, you know what sequoia has proven more than anything else to me is the value of doubling down and backing up your winners And so to the extent that money isn't infinite, which it isn't for all of us That's when I do think it's worthwhile saying well, I have a certain amount of money in my fund If I think calm can 10x from here Then I'd rather put in a big check there and you know, that's better than putting a bunch of c checks into companies We'll still have a 90% failure rate at very very high prices where I don't know That much so I do think active risk management makes sense in moments like this I mean, I guess my philosophy is a little different J.

Cal. I mean, so I My philosophy is a VC is that the market sets the price of the deals that I'm ultimately a price taker and My only decision really is which deals I want to be in like I don't really get to set the prices It's too easy for entrepreneurs to run a process and get competing bids So all I can really do is decide which deals I want to be in and I think the more that you try to chase value As a VC, I think the more you end up investing in companies that aren't really that great Like you're trying to you're trying to find things that are mispriced as opposed to just investing in the best companies So now look does do price levels affect my returns? I think yes, I'm sure the advantages do matter to some degree, but The most important thing is just to be in the right in the right companies Can I just can I just I'll give you the counterfactual to what you just said, you know, if I if I look at my three big funds Fund one was healthcare education fintech and some deep tech Fun two was a massive overindexation into SaaS And then fund three was a return to our knitting and a bunch of deep tech stuff And a lot of fund threes decisions was basically me saying enough of the sass and the reason was because I didn't like the valuations David and I thought on the margin if I'm going to invest 10 million dollars I'd rather get a 3d printing spaceship company off the ground Then the n plus for a sass business and it's turned out To have been in that cohort the right decision.

So I don't know. I think it's I think that can also be true Which is like chasing what was the hottest thing was not in 2016 Was not a good idea. Yeah, so so just let me just respond to it real quick jason because so So I do like sass investing, but I was doing it before it got hot You know, it's just that's kind of my area and I want to build a franchise in that area because that's where my expertise are And so I can't like very well Just say hey the store is closed this year because price levels are high Otherwise like founders won't come you have to invest through this.

Yeah, exactly So I'm trying to create like a very specific franchise in being the leading VC and bottom up sass and look sometimes the price levels be favorable during Covid There was like a four month period where the markets were off what 50% everyone like it felt like we had the market to ourselves The VC market. I mean nobody else was investing We did more deals during that four month period than I think any other four month period So like sometimes the price levels can bounce in your favor But you know my view on it is I just want to invest the best companies and kind of the the price levels was work themselves out the counter I would have to your counter david was if There are other startups who are of equal value Which pool you decide to go fishing in matters? So You know this 30 million dollar deal if I was to put three million dollars into it That could equal me putting with our accelerator, which not everybody runs an accelerator.

It's arduous. It's painful It takes a ton of work, but that equals for me 30 deals at 100k Each so I'm looking at it going do I get one bet in this yc overpriced company with 50 You know tier three venture capitalist and dentist backing up the truck and now family offices Who don't know anything are now competing against the people they are lps and their funds Or do I just say you know what if everybody's fighting in the market for the apples? I'm going to plant more apple trees and I'm going to run a better orchard And that's what I decided to do is maybe I'll just move up to the orchard a little bit But I guess there's multiple ways to win in what we do But you guys are broader in your strategy than I am right like you guys actually do invest in lots of different kinds of companies I've kind of gravitated away from that because I'd rather just focus on my speciality Which I feel like is big enough for me to be successful, right? Yeah, but what if there's a new category that comes out like on demand and something like uber comes along or air bnb And it doesn't fit the framework Well, I invested in those companies, but so marketplaces would you do it now? Or would your team say you know what don't bring this to david? He's going to say no Because your team is doing the first round interviews, right? Yeah, but but we do marketplaces and my partner just didn't look like marketplaces originally though Those are not considered like ebay or crisis.

I invested in them because I thought they were marketplaces So you know, so look we do marketplaces and we do sas. That's a huge part of the market We're never going to suffer for for deal flow focusing on those things. But look, will I do chips? No Will I do pharma? No, because I don't know anything about those things. Yeah, no, those are too deep or quantum computing or something like that You know, these more esoteric hard tech subjects that I kind of make fun of free birk for Or at least, you know, when he starts giving his cubit um lecture Yeah, well actually no one's no one's a big one.

I actually think we need to really rethink our investment strategy here I forgot to tell you guys. I'm going to start investing in laundromats Very simple. I want to yeah, it's not a bad idea I mean one of our mutual friend one of our besties who's who's a stealth bestie was really into the domino's Chains and boy was he right about that that's not going crazy. I want to get into this. Is it archegos? archegos Machiego cheese. I want to get this archegos thing Um, but I also want to point out two things from just housekeeping number one I redirected wet your beak to a type form For people to pitch the besties guess how many pitches came in in the first week How many over 1,000 I now have three researchers going through it and categorizing it They're going to share a google sheet back with yall of by stage where they are to start going through them But it's pretty amazing.

I think there's some I think there's some magic that's going to happen here where we're going to find a deal where all four besties can be in Deal because we've got two besties in pipe We're both in cabana sacks and I and a couple of other companies But we got to get a four we need to get four of a kind. We've never had four of a kind. We've had we've hit sets We've hit a pair, but we've never hit that go ahead sacks. What do you want to do? You want to talk about me? Selling your deal flow.

Yeah, exactly. I just want to put out a I need to put out a little ps a so if you're a founder out there listening and you have a sass deal That's post revenue send it to me at craft ventures and if it's everything else you can send it to jason on his little His uh, no, no, no, there were a lot of sass companies actually And so what we should do is I can set the type form up if you want if you give me an email address Anybody who picks sass I could have an email you or you know, kevin or whoever on your team You want to and I could just redirect it in real time But that could wind up being hundreds of emails, but I think that's what you want.

All right. Well, no actually well No, jason you should you should divvy up jason you should divvy up all these Pitches by subject matter and send it to the bestie who it's most relevant for all right sounds good. We'll do that sure and then second on the Um housekeeping front people were really interested in this longevity discussion Oh read the thing read the thing. I think I want to because I want to talk about it again So ben sent this in to the all in um twitter handle, which is I think the all in pod And it's got 70.

Do you guys know we have 70 000 followers on that twitter handle? It's crazy Hey, just wanted to reach out with a positive message after listening to the podcast from two fridays ago If you could pass the message along to the besties, I think that's us after trommat's recommendation regarding longevity I suggested to my dad age 56 in perfect health. So he's 10 years younger than sax looks To go get a calcium dye test It turns out he scored well above any safe number and a critical heart failure was inevitable Now he's taking proactive steps with a cardiologist It's hard to even fathom what would have happened if chumaf had Impassionately recommended this action.

Thank you guys so much for providing value weekend I just I want to chumaf saving lives Chumaf saving lives and making billions No, don't don't joke around. It's stupid on this topic. I really want to say this again if anybody Um hasn't done it after the age of 40. You can get a ct angiogram Um most health services provide it Um, I would really ask your primary care physician if they say no Tell them to go fuck themselves and find somebody who will give it to you But this is one of these things where if your calcium score is greater than zero It doubles every year and there's a certain score right above several thousand where you are guaranteed to have some Meaningful cardiac issue and so whether it's for you or your parents Just ask the question.

Have you had a contrast ct angi done? And if not go and find a doctor who will prescribe it to them and get it done It's just a no brainer. I um, I took it's a no brainer. It's a no brainer and I I had my yearly physical and I got the um Heart flow No, I just did my physical but I I'm going to do that um full body scan you recommended pre pre nuvo pre nuvo I'm doing and then I got on the nat plus booster the true nitrogen that um, yeah I think uh, that free bergs suggested and I'm taking it seriously and I started with my personal trainer two Tuesdays ago And I changed my entire diet and I'm just Really taking it seriously now because I hit 50 So let me tell me tell you about our chegos.

So here's a guy. This is incredible. So this guy, uh, ran Asia pack for julian robertson julian robertson is a legend of finance and capital markets and was the founder of tiger Tiger management. By the way, I heard this incredible story Um, why did julian? Name it tiger management Apparently he had an he was incredibly bad with names and so he would just call everybody tiger like hey tiger How you doing tiger tiger tiger tiger? And so when he started this fun I think his son apparently told him dad, you're not going to remember anybody's name You're not even going to remember the name of the company.

Just call it tiger management and you'll remember it anyways julian is famous for having um Attracted an incredible roster of people to work for him It's what the paypal mafia would look like if it were disguised as a hedge fund all these amazing people worked for julian went off and did these other incredible things and um One of these guys one of these guys was this guy bill huang who ran asia pack for tiger He leaves he starts his own fund and somewhere in 2011. He gets pinched Uh by the feds for insider trading some chinese bank stocks He pays a 60 million dollar criminal and civil penalty and he's forced to give back all of his outside money And so now he's a family office Then he takes however much money he had and he runs it up to somewhere between five and ten billion dollars So this is a guy who managed to just hit the ball out of the park And then what he does is he goes to these banks and he says you know what guys i'm going to make a bunch of concentrated bets in a bunch of chinese internet companies and uh media companies like via common discovery So what he does is he does an equity swap And what an equity swap is to to to get through all the noise is just a very simple way For you to bet on the appreciation of a stock relative to an index and hedge it against an index And what it synthetically allows you to do is take big risk own huge positions and not be Listed in disclosures.

So if you don't want to buy the stock Yeah, so if you don't want to know so the word synthetic just so because i'm confused synthetic means you're not actually buying the stock You're doing this in the ether if you went and bought About 4.9 percent of viacom nothing would happen the minute you got to five percent you'd have a regulatory filing Obligation that would say jason calcanis owns five percent of viacom Then at nine point nine percent nothing else would happen, but then at ten percent there's another incremental thing so This was a way of him accumulating up to nine point nine or ten percent of these positions without Having to disclose because he's not actually buying the stock.

He's having morgan stanley golden sacks uh nomura deutche bank credit suise buy the stock for him using these Uh over the counter derivatives, but they're not he they they in some cases didn't even buy the stock It was like a forward purchase agreement almost right like these these were uh, these were contracts for difference So they didn't even have to buy the stock in a lot of cases, right? Right? And then I think it was hedged by uh the s&p, right? So they basically hedged out with the s&p and it was like factor weighted Anyways long story short what happens is that uh the guy starts to get stopped out on a trade And then they have to close out all these positions and so all of a sudden they realize oh my gosh We actually each of us gave this guy five or ten times leverage So instead of a five or ten billion dollar hedge fund it was 50 billion dollars of notional exposure And so in one day you had viacom go down 30 percent Discovery went down 30 or 40 and we were playing cards looking at the market saying what's going on? What's going on? Yeah, so weird but another another example of like asymmetric information and a lack of transparency and financial There were two drivers of this number one is the guy traded via these swap These these over the counter transaction.

So he didn't actually have to go buy the stock on the market and number two is they uh The the guy relied on a number of exemptions as a family office, right? Chumat so he didn't have a lot of reporting requirements that say, um, you know a lot of other funds might might might have to disclose And so there was a kind of Opacity to the transactions that were going on So ultimately when um when everyone kind of looked under the hood it was like, uh, oh This is a lot like that long term capital management Fiasco that happened in 1997.

I think we talked about it on one of the the shows But they had a book with like 60,000 derivative contracts With over a trillion dollars of notional exposure on a five billion dollar book of business So if you know if the overall The portfolio that they held moved by whatever it is, you know half a percent The whole thing collapses and that's effectively what happened when stocks got volatile in 1997 During that currency crisis and then all the banks looked under the hood and they're like, oh, wait I need more collateral There was no collateral to post because everything was levered up and then everyone's struggling to get a piece of the pie You know of the cash that's left everyone was fighting to get a piece of it Because if everyone had to sell off the whole portfolio would collapse and everything starts to spiral out of control And that's sort of what happened on Friday, right? Because as they started to sell off these positions via big block trades The stock went down and made it even harder and then everyone piles on and start shorting the stock and it becomes this Uncontrollable fiasco.

I have a really dumb question for the why are people giving this amount of leverage and letting people make these trades? Is it because they have no responsibility the brokerage houses or whatever's clearing these? They're gonna lose they're gonna lose money I mean, I think JP Morgan Nomura these guys are all gonna lose billions of dollars because there's not enough cash In the sky's actual account to cover all the losses now Why would they let him do this is my really simple stupid question somebody Because they make money they make money. I mean if you're making five look, I mean think about it this way It's sort of like an insurance deal, right? Like if I can make five cents by taking a dollar of exposure with you But that exposure only pays out if something terrible happens that's very unlikely in my assessment I'll take that five cents all day long, you know, I'm collecting nickels But once once in a while something really bad happens and then they got to pay out a dollar How many more manchie goes are out there? Well, I think I think it depends on how you define the problem, but if you say that it leverage Everybody's levered.

I think the question is by how much I think it's pretty rare at this point That you're not levered we don't run leverage, but it's tantalizing I got to tell you because like, you know, I could run I don't know 100 150 billion dollars of exposure and then all of a sudden You know, you only have to return You know one or two percent to make a ton of money Yeah, chibas What would your margin interest rate be if you were to run your your book levered I could run it 10 times and pay 1% 2% right that's crazy, right? So with 10 times leverage on your money You you basically just have to beat one point or two point a return and you make money that's why it's so attractive right now That's why it's so attractive and that's what that's what that's what a lot of these other organizations do the business model that they've perfected Which I think is very reasonable by the way says again back to sort of like You know managing year to date risk, right? They manage extremely small movements and stocks because instead of hat saying to You know if the four of us were running a hedge fund hey, each of you do your best and we're going to run one times notional It's much better to say I'm going to severely constrain The parameters in which you guys can take risk and on the back end I'm going to lever the whole thing up 10 times My only goal is for you guys to make me 1% a year Right because if I lever it up 10 times now I've made 10% And that 1% a year now all of a sudden divided by 12 months of the year means you're generally You know you only have to do 80 basis So all of a sudden the math starts to work in your favor where everybody says wow, let's raise as much money as possible Let's make sure there's extremely tight risk parameters Let's just tell David Friedberg and Jason Calcanis and David Sacks.

Just give me 80 basis points And on the back end I lever up that's the whole business model of most hedge funds And then you know you have some folks at the edges as Friedberg says, you know the insurance policy Rarely pays out But then every now and then you have this cataclysmic set of events and the long tail hits and you're wiped out and that's what happened You and by the way, you know, there are stress tests against the banks to and where they basically look at scenarios of You know, how bad can the overall portfolio get that the banks are exposed to you know All these clients that they have as counterparty risks because remember like when they sign a contract with this hedge fund They're not actually taking a position.

What they're doing is they're taking They're creating an obligation where this hedge fund has to pay them in the future Now if the hedge fund effectively goes bankrupt Then they're not going to get paid on the mean on the back end They're expecting to get paid two billion dollars or whatever the amount might be to cover the You know the trade that they put in place with the guy. So this whole thing basically becomes a loss that they get exposed to And so the stress tests are meant to kind of expose How bad can the loss be to make sure that the bank doesn't ultimately go bankrupt if a really bad scenario were to take place Now there's a lot of debate about whether those stress test methodologies actually work And whether they adequately reflect the true risk in the markets and the true risk that these banks take on And that has always been a debate the problem is if you make the stress tests too limiting The cost of capital goes up and it's very hard to trade and liquidity goes down in the market That's the the counter argument to why you wouldn't want to be kind of more regulatory on this front And so it's an ongoing kind of fluid debate about what's the right way to stress test banks and make sure that they have adequate capital reserves While still creating low cost capital and having liquidity in the markets, but you add the risk of ruin So it's really it's really hard to balance playing with your entire net worth on the poker table You're not just buying in with one percent of it or 10 percent of it Well, the yeah, whenever you read a story about some rich person going broke It's there's always debt involved, right? Because yeah, let's say let's say you got like I don't know like a big number like 100 million dollars Right and and let's say you're fully invested the market goes down 50 percent.

You still got 50 million bucks You're still like a very rich person. Yeah. Yeah, but now let's say that you took that 100 million And you levered it up to I don't know whatever a billion a billion and then the market goes down 50 percent You're worth zero Yeah, or in that case the market could go down 10 percent sacks and that's what happened here, right? Only 10 percent right exactly the guy levered it up and this is what always this is what happened with ltcm In ltcm's case the the trades they had the whole portfolio only moved like 5 percent But it caused a cataclysmic collapse of hundreds of billions of dollars of notional exposure And that that's sort of like what happened with this guy.

He was so levered up It's so weird, you know, I searched for this guy on youtube just to kind of figure out who he was on saturday Oh the the christian youtube thing you saw and I sent it to the group But there's like all these videos of him talking about jesus and it was just a I'm fine with him being deep into jesus, especially, right, you know on the way to easter god bless you praise jesus But it was very weird that he this person has a very unique philosophy clearly and no no more Laura the prime broker on monday warned of significant losses Estimated at two billion From the unwinding of these trades Can let me ask let me ask a question to you guys if if we all agree It's a really bad idea for individuals to get overlevered like this How bad an idea is it that the u.s.

Government is getting so overlevered? We now have 130 percent of our gdp. We are now in debt It's the first I mean, we're I think it only recently crossed 100 percent So we we have now borrowed as a country more than our entire gdp And I mean if you look at that by country there are other countries that are way over that Like japan just about there aren't that many there aren't that many and japan's had a horrible decade partly because of all that debt Italy, portugal, greece and japan. Yeah, yeah, not you want to be part of not a club I I I I I think that I'm more sympathetic to governments being overlevered because I think Because governments effectively are at this point still that may not be the case in the future The the only form of too big to fail that I think we can tolerate I have a much bigger issue with private market participants being overlevered because I think that is a level of greed and risk that Shouldn't exist Unnecessary in large part because the governments themselves are so levered on the way in so maybe that's the way to think about it Which is if we have to isolate risk and we know we can't tell governments to stop spending Then I think we should probably make sure that risk is better managed at the individual level, you know people and companies do we why can't we why can't we tell governments Yeah, it's about to say Because we vote them in but I mean this I I want to open up people like people vote in spenders people don't vote in Well, this is the thing, you know the republicans were supposed to be the spend thrifts.

Yeah, no one ever gets elected saying I'm not going to do anything Right. I mean Donald Trump may be the first president to have ever actually said that and you know actually do something In that vein when he put a bunch of guys in charge of like the cdc and the department of energy and they just cut heads But you know you always go in and you say I'm going to do x that isn't being done today And as a result over generations It adds up and all of a sudden you wake up and the united states is 250 years old And we have debt equal to 130 percent of our GDP and we're struggling to maintain the growth rates needed to fund that debt And you're like, uh, oh That's the biggest challenge with democracy and keeping it alive.

There's um Is the fact that ultimately Everyone wants more And so over time you vote for more and over time it gets more expensive and over time it becomes really difficult to maintain Can I can I just count up the bill for just this year? So as we know already passed it one. Well, yeah So the the bill so far for this year first of all the government is is running like a four and a half trillion dollar deficit A lot of that is you know, covet related but in any event biden's already passed a 1.9

trillion dollar Uh covet bill they're now about to pass a at least three trillion dollar infrastructure bill To to to the proposal came out. It's two. No, yeah. Well, okay. Sorry. It's it's two for the infrastructure plan But then there's another one to two billion that they're talking about doing sorry trillion that they're they're planning as a second Package called the american families plan that they're calling infrastructure, but it's it's not it's more like social programs They're kind of relabeling that as social infrastructure or human infrastructure And they're trying to figure out whether they can do them as two separate bills Um, there's this issue with reconciliation and they need they need a ruling from the senate parliamentarian on whether they can do the second bill through Through reconciliation if they can't they may have to combine it into one bill.

Otherwise, I'll do just two separate bills Um, but you're looking at total like four about four trillion across those two bills You know in addition to the 1.9 we've already passed so we're looking at like six trillion Of spending this year. I think we had about six trillion of covet emergency spending last year And so the numbers are getting really big really fast This reminds me of our last trip. This reminds me of last vegas trip with shippuriani and then your markers We may need to have some austerity measures We might need to go to olive gardens instead of shippuriani Part of the issue sacks is um, you know, I think if you guys will remember on election night I told you the thing I was most concerned about was this georgia runoff And if the senate takes if the democrats take the senate you have no balance of negotiation in this process of Of passing these bills and finding a point of fiscal responsibility versus social necessity Or what might be deemed a necessity by some but but um, uh, you know exuberance by others And um, and it's it's it's frightening because you know with a with a single party system, right a single party, um, uh legislative branch or Right now we have a real issue with the The fact that any bill can kind of be come up.

It can kind of be defined by one party by a small group of people They can get it passed. They can get it signed And you know, it's going to be a challenge for for us to all kind of support this level of debt for generations to come Um, and it's uh, it's not going to stop anytime soon. I mean, you know before the midterms We've got another year and a half of this 100% and that's why I was rooting in the the the last election for gridlock as well And uh, and we we almost had it.

I mean it was supposed to be a divided senate Purdue won that senate seat and then he lost decided to Burn the entire Republican party on the way out Congratulations, david You destroyed the republic you look you you jake, how you have a little bit of a point there because the reality is as of election night This was supposed to be a divided senate and then what happened in the two months that followed Turned voters against those senate candidates. So you have you definitely have a point there But but the the price tag for that one senate seat is going to be about six trillion dollars.

Yep It's pretty disturbing that our Our debt to gdp ratio is not worse than spain in portugal. I mean I think it's worth just explaining to people why that matters right sacks I mean like when you when you have to pay you have to pay Well, here's here's the thing here. Here's the thing everyone's been Everyone's been lulled into a false sense of security because interest rates are so low So the debt service has actually been relatively small But if interest rates ever go back up say because of inflation Like the debt service will be one of the biggest chunks of federal spending.

We won't have money left for all the programs that we need Um, you know including entitlements including defense including everything else, you know, the country wants to do and so it's very dangerous And and the the real problem I have with it right now is Everybody can see the economy is getting better, right? It's it looks like we're about to have the roaring 20s the economy looks like It's rebounding. It's about to boom Goldman Sachs says we're gonna be down to like 3% unemployment by the end of the year It's coming back really fast. COVID is gonna be over in may I mean everything is trending the right way and we're acting like you know, like there's an emergency happening still I mean, I understand the six trillion last year During the middle of COVID to prevent a depression But what is the rationale today when the economy is already coming back for this election? David re election to consolidate democratic power and to get reelected Right pump the prime the pump But you know, we're we're breaking the glass in case there's an emergency when there is no emergency And what happens if there is another emergency will go to 150% look I don't think it says as intentional as getting reelected I do think that the politicians and the people involved in the legislative process have very good intentions And think they're doing the right thing and they got elected and they spent their whole lives and their whole career is dreaming of a day When they could create these programs using government money dreaming of a day when they could make these opportunities real And here's a moment in time where they can and where these visions for what they believe to be a better society and a better government And a better country for all its citizens They have this moment now and they are and so i'm not criticizing anyone I think it's just I think it's look Yeah, no, you can totally disagree with the point and I think in many cases I agree with you But I do think that there isn't like this um this kind of evil incentive or this evil reason for folks doing it I think you know a lot of people that work in government or politicians They spend a lot of time thinking about doing what's best for their you know, their their their kind of people that they represent And here's this moment where I can create all these programs and create all these jobs and spend all this government money to give my people locally all these all the support that I always thought that I always told them I would give them one day And it's a moment where everyone's kind of rushing and because there's a single party system right now Everything's getting done and it's all getting piled on top of pile It's like leading eating cupcakes and then cake and then pancakes and then You know ice cream and then having a milkshake, you know, it's um, it's it's gonna have a really nasty stomachache at the end Yeah, I agree.

It's it's it we may have a sugar rush over the next year or two Maybe maybe biden gets reelected based on this but you know, eventually I like I like your term stomach ache biden seems to me a little bit miscast it's like he's cast from a different era And you know, this is not 1933. We don't need this massive amount of pump priming by the federal government. We're not in a depression We're not even in a recession right now. We're coming back really strongly And so it just feels like we're passing all this anachronistic pork barrel Spending, you know, like for why it's like almost like it's just habitual as opposed to having a real need I think that's a more nuanced take which I agree with which is like if you actually see What that two trillion dollar infrastructure bill look like there was a lot of stuff which did feel incredibly anachronistic where I was like I mean Paving a fucking road.

I mean, we had China trolling us because the the contents of yeah, you saw that stupid right? It's like I mean It's like paving a road is this one time event that does nothing and we're much we're much better off building ongoing capability of things we need so if we're gonna like Green the economy and you know, we're gonna go through go through an energy transition There's all kinds of ways to spend the money and so then you think Who's advising these people? Well, and then and then I think it comes back to lobbyists Yeah, obvious and donors.

Yeah, let's go through this list, right? So of the two trillion dollars It looks like about six hundred and twenty billion is going into transportation Infrastructure like Chumov said bridges roads public transit, etc Now if you think about the benefit to society, there's the benefit of having better infrastructure The benefit of having better roads which we can debate does it you know, do all of these need this care the six hundred and twenty billion dollars worth of care I think some people would say yes some people say no but The question of where that those dollars actually go ultimately if you kind of look at how government contract work is done There will be a few people that own the majority of these contract service providers that will benefit heavily From this capital coming out of the government's coffers and will go into their bank accounts And yes, there will be some jobs But they will be temporary jobs and there will be temporary salary and wage support through this a lot of that capital Will go to the people that own the businesses that are doing all of the construction work and supporting this industry Development so you know it's concerning when you look at how much money is going to get funneled into effectively corporate contracting I don't care.

I don't care what side of the aisle you're on but if you see six hundred and twenty billion dollars Of spending that's going to happen in the next few years for anything If you're thinking anything other than this will be wasted and inefficient you're being really naive So, you know the the good a good microcosm example of this is the one that you use Friedberg Which is how much money did california give to Anderson consulting or you know to build that covet website It was yeah It was like a hundred million bucks like all in with the service cost and the customer support and all the stuff that was attached to it And and realistically you could have built it for 90 bucks using wicks You know where's where's been use the promo code twist come on use the promo code So my uh, so my my thought is that exactly like people should look at this irrespective of what you're on the left or right Think well of that six twenty how much will actually get into the hands of people in a thoughtful way Man, probably like 300 how much of it will go into like lining the pockets of Shareholders and folks in very specific companies who just print an enormous amount of profit over the next few years Probably another 150 or 200 billion wait a second Sass did you did you send my red pills to chumat's house? What's going on here? But let's have the counter argument right the counter argument is for decades and i'll make it right so for decades roads have been crumbling Infrastructure in this country has been falling apart.

We haven't taken care of federal highways There's all this work that needs to be done to make sure that airports address rural communities and ports can take ships in So the economy can grow and someone's got to build all that stuff at some point So you know rather than deal with this down the road. Let's take advantage of the single party You know governing system we have right now and pass this bill and get it all done and get and get America ready for the future That would be the argument right i'll give you the most cynical argument the most cynical argument is Let's ratchet up spending Make everybody concerned about the debt so that the solution is Let's raise taxes and let's create a wealth tax on that's great this tax and that Biden is raising taxes Raising the corporate tax rate to 28% but that was but that was brilliant individual individual yeah Like I think raising the corporate tax is a no brainer.

We should absolutely have done that But David, I mean Friedberg back to what you said before what I would have said is like Look the the counter the counter argument would have been let's take this $620 billion and plan the future So the plan the future would be you know, um, why is it that like elon can can? Bore a you know a traffic Bearing tunnel at a million dollars a mile and the next best equivalent is 20 million a mile Okay, maybe we should give these guys a bunch of contracts and say yeah Well just and technology I would say and and less graft and less waste So let these guys build a bunch of tunnels and maybe they can figure out a way to build bridges too Or you know, if you really want to care about like future jobs in the national security of america Let's secure our own precious metals and minerals and let's have an entire supply chain.

That's you know independent of china Well, you could spend a couple hundred billion dollars on that easily So there's all kinds of ways to spend it. We could build high speed rail You know, they do have 580 billion so almost a quarter a little over a quarter of this bill Going to american manufacturing rnd and job training right so creating the next generation of jobs for americans and yeah We like that, you know redomesticating industry here I I mean honestly those words sound nice. What are the yeah, exactly? You like the words you like the words you really love the words I mean, I like I mean one that I think Nobody can argue with this universal pre kindergarten.

That's easy and I think community college tuition Being free is a great one as well if people have a certain score to get in there. So it's a little bit of merit Jason what are these things even what are these things even doing in an infrastructure bill? I feel like in I think freeberg has a point that like infrastructure is like one of the last things that people believe that the government should Be spending money on so now they're just branding anything that they want to do as infrastructure there, you know infrastructure infrastructure Right not to say education and childcare and college.

That's education should be a different bill But didn't I mean obama tried to get Infrastructure passed he couldn't trump. No, no, he did no, no, no, no obama passed close to a trillion I think it was like a nine hundred twenty billion dollar bill remember the shovel ready projects It was supposed to be a trillion dollars a shovel ready projects. They did it. Where'd that money go? Well speaking about money speaking about money disappearing Can you whatever you want to the little shrug emoji con like the I don't know. There's my yeah, there's the bright.

Here's the brown version and I Know here's the white here's the pale white version and there's the brown version And it looks like you're the tan version freeberg you get a little sun A trillion dollars me no no Well, we can all go to vegas and we can lose money to just come up to our wives and go like this I just think like the government's so bad at like properly dispensing all this money Like that's the problem that you know and then that would look I think if you're ever going to do infrastructure The time to do it was in 2009 when obama did it like the economy was an absolute like Like a great recession that made that made sense But now when the economy is doing is rebounding so strongly Do you really believe that these you know a hundred billion dollar line items are going to be wisely spent? You know and and most of it's borrowed money so No, and the problem is like by the time it gets into the details well beyond What biden is capable or has the time to learn about it will be just completely? Misallocated and you know some lobbyists will insert something that gets Something that's important to some politician the money and that and that and that's the that's the sad truth of it all And we just have to hope that there's enough good that comes out of it and now taxes are coming for you Well, I mean that's that's the next thing is the wealth tax Is or where that conversation is what happened in that what happened in the bill? Well aca I saw I saw the corporate tax went up from 21 to 28, but what else happened? Well, there's a wealth tax in california being discussed again.

Who knows okay, but at the federal level was there anything? I didn't know about I mean, I don't know if that's possible the first the first bill is going to be funded by like you said an increase in the Corporate tax from 21 to 28 percent the second bill the families act is going to be funded in part by personal income tax increases, which I think will be more controversial. They're going to bump up uh Well the campaign statement that biden made was individuals no one making under 400,000 would see a tax increase So the plan was 400,000 going up to 39.6

percent But here's here's where I think it could get very controversial is that the white house is already making Noises that it wasn't 400,000 per individual it was 400,000 dollars per family Which would mean 200,000 dollars per individual which would be I pretty much a camp a broken campaign promise So if that's where it ends up being I think biden could take a lot of heat for that Um and but but the problem is if he sticks to 400,000 per individual I'm not sure that it will raise enough the tax increase will raise enough money to pay for everything he wants to pay for So it'll be interesting.

I would be I would be totally okay with this when I was 30 years old. I'm just putting that on the record What is This may sound dumb, but what is the federal tax rate? Like what what is it going from? I think that the top the top rates like 37 and a half so it's a 2% It's not a big it's not a gigantic increase at all. It's a big nothing burger. Okay. Yeah, and this is income tax again Not capital gains. It'll be yeah, and then there's a bunch of questions about whether Like so capital gains is still a big question mark and capital gains will all go to income Yeah, there's there's a big push.

Yeah No way. I don't think there's a big push but they haven't said yet So this is going to be part of the second bill which they're talking about doing I think in october So You know watch out. Okay, wait a second if they go if they if the capital gains happens then the whole idea of being a capital allocator It's going to change everything wouldn't it? I think it's a bigger issue than that It has less to do with that But you have 30 trillion dollars sitting in 401ks and iras and the idea that you'll tax all of those gains In a differentiated way.

I think it's going to be a very complicated proposition. Well, those aren't taxed Well, they're taxed on the way out, right? You still pay something on that if you hold until you're 55 But I mean whatever you're going to live to 110. So so yeah, axios actually had a story just today that the infrastructure bill like does not include capital gains taxes But the big question is what they'll do in the next bill You know, and that's and then so you combine that let's just say The federal government decides capital gains. We don't want to invest in companies anymore We don't want to treat stock gains the same because we want to have more equity equality, whatever Then you combine that with this wealth tax proposal in california ac8 is a resolution to propose an amendment to the constitution of state co authors Have proposed a wealth tax described as a 1% surcharge for amounts over 50 million and 1.5

percent for amounts over 1 billion so if you're a billionaire Uh, just you're gonna have to pay, you know 15. Can I make a case to you guys? I've kind of been thinking about this, but I'd love your your feedback on it So I feel like there's a tradeoff between freedom and equality um, and and what I mean by that is if you if you give um, a market freedom A market of people doing things freedom um You maximize progress that that society achieves and the united states is the best case study of this in history in 250 years we went from a bunch of people living on plantations or living on small farms to a You know the largest economy in the world um, and so the more freedom you you provide The the more innovation there is the more entrepreneurship.

There is the more of inventing new stuff there is the problem with progress Progress takes everyone forward But progress is always asymmetric Meaning some people end up in a greater point further ahead than everyone then a lot of other people do Whereas like a socialist state with less freedom Incentives you take everyone forward together, but you don't make as much progress And so if you want to have freedom You have the most amount of progress, but you have the least amount of equality over time Even though everyone is further ahead than where they started 200 years ago or 100 years ago or even 10 years ago Everyone's in a better position than say they were some period of time ago because we've all got better social Security programs and whatnot There are some people that get so much farther ahead like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and these people that you can now look to and say This is unfair.

This person's taken so much capital and I've only made You know a 10 increase in the last 10 years and so as a result they're in a democracy There is always this tension between freedom and equality And those are the two things that cycle in terms of what voters vote for we're coming into a cycle now Where we're going to start to vote down freedom and vote up equality And this is sort of what the wealth tax in my mind represents is this this kind of Redistribution or this returning to a kind of the mean or reversion to the mean in terms of like get everyone back on the same page But as a result we're going to see much less progress economically We're going to see much less progress in terms of innovation and other places that have more freedom And enable more innovation and infrastructure and entrepreneurship Are going to be able to kind of leap ahead and have greater progress than us That's my kind of rant and thesis, but I'd love you guys is I would amend your your thesis slightly to say that freedom produces prosperity Right and prosperity Does produce some inequality because there are always people like Elon or Jeff Bezos or whatever who are just going to be like Super producers especially in the era of technology where you can create a machine to produce goods and services And that machine Can be thousands or millions of times as productive as the ordinary person So they're going to build extraordinary wealth, but the but look the the free the the basic idea of liberal society is you have a Free enterprise system where people are generally free to create their companies and their businesses And then you have a social safety net that's paid for by the large s of that system And the thing about socialism is it can only make it we talked about this last time It can only make everyone equally poor.

It never makes everyone equally rich You end up killing the golden goose for everybody And and you also end up with a lot less freedom because you end up with a gigantic state That exists to level everything and they accrue all this power for themselves But is that actually true like if you look at china Is that really what's happened in china china's kicking everybody's ass and they're basically a socialist Yeah, this is for they're authoritarian Exactly. They're they're They're sort of they're sort of politically using using freedberg's language They don't have as much freedom or that freedom is granted by You know authority a central authority.

Yeah, which makes them authoritarian by definition Which means somebody like jack ma Can do amazing until he but that's it. But that's a perfect example. He's still doing fine He's got 50 billion maybe doesn't Imagine what he could do if he could keep going and and this is a point I wanted to make which is what if you got Elizabeth Warren or Bernie sander's proposals enacted and Bernie sander's gone on tv many times and said there should be no billionaires If Jeff Bezos stopped building amazon when he made a billion dollars because he was forced to by the government At that point all the future benefit of amazon would have been lost It's not like someone else would have been able to step in on top of that platform and build more And then the next guy steps in and makes the next billion and I just want to remind everyone The the the benefits of amazon are Extraordinary I mean imagine going back 20 years and being or being a kid And I can go in my friggin phone and I can say I want something and it chills up at my door the next day For same little for same day for very little money.

I mean it is fucking mind blowing what amazon has built for us for society It's an incredible business at the same time And we are all willing to give that business money because the benefit of what they do for us is so extraordinary And if you had capped Jeff Bezos's wealth or capped his ability to kind of keep elongating what that business could do at some point It would have been an absolute Travesty and I would argue that even though jack ma was doing fine There are people in china who are limited in terms of what they can do because of the way that that government limits freedom and limits Flexibility and so to me I'm observing this tension between freedom and equality where equality is becoming such a sticking point for people now That it is far more important than freedom and as a result we are going to start to see these little things creeping in like a Wealth tax or a limit on billionaires or all this sort of stuff that ultimately limits the ability for people to kind of push their businesses and elongate Progress and if you looked at the great scientific and technical discoveries of the last 30 years So many of them came from the united states because of this this freedom Not from china and china has certainly done fine But they're a great photocopy machine and they're great at saying hey, here's some slave labor Has been here the innovation has been in the united states Yeah, china observed what was working in the us and they realized that they should adopt markets because markets create Prosperity they create goods that create services they create, you know wealth for their people So they've embraced markets and then meanwhile we're moving away from markets or we have such skepticism of markets You've got this sort of extreme socialist sort of bernie wing Of the of the party that is kind of moving away from markets.

It's as bizarre, you know I mean, and then you just look at the free market in the amazon example They demanded a $15 minimum wage. They got the $15 minimum wage and now they're still attacking amazon and chev bezos And so it's never going to be enough for them. They want to see him get rid of all of his money. No, no, no, that's right I think I think that you're saying something else jason, which is really important I think people you have to think about the generation of kids that have been raised by boomers And and that'll explain the psychology of why they think that way You know, we had all kinds of failure modes growing up, you know, we meaning, you know, I'm in my mid 40s If you think of our generation and older, right, we all had failure modes You wouldn't get into the schools you wanted you, you know, basically had a lot more freedom where You know after school you were latchkey kid, you know, you would have just all kinds of like very nominal ways of growing up Um, you didn't necessarily get to play on the school team if you didn't make it You know, and those boundary conditions create these great stories like the michael jordan's of the world And then you fast forward to how boomers felt and I think that boomers felt an enormous amount of guilt About their stresses on the system.

And what did they do to millennials and gen z? You got they got everything they wanted It was kindergarten soccer. Everybody gets a gold star And now you have an entire generation of people that quite honestly are like wondering like they actually have been raised in a quasi socialist setting You know, if you go if you go to school, there is no free speech if you do a project and you know, your grades aren't good You can get a redo. Everything's a redo. Everything's a retrait. Everything's a we're going to manage to the middle You can't lose and you can't lose and in that not losing Um, I think people have forgot what it feels like to actually win and that humans are actually in many ways Like darwin's perfect example of winning, you know, like why us and not a other strain of chimpanzee? Because we need we wanted to win more than anybody else as it turned out Um, and that's lost we've lost that script And so I think part of it is you have an entire generation of people who Whatever you do, it's not enough It's because they were raised in a society where they never had to actually learn what functional winning and losing felt like And or or it's been deeply minimized said another way that we've gotten soft And we're about to get our asses kicked by china if we don't start to realize That a vibrant competition of ideas and products and services is what wins I think we have a more dangerous thing than that jason.

It's not that that's gone I think it's actually more this selective idea. So for example, like if you were um A fashion designer creating clothes on Shopify or fashion nova You're allowed to compete and win But if you build a technology that aggregates resources and that has these crazy gross margins of profit margins You're not allowed to win So we've actually gotten into this very contorted period where we want to choose how to define what winning feels like to us And I think that's where it's dangerous because that's a very subjective thing and it ebbs and flows Can we go back to the wealth tax for a second because I think this is like monumentally Yeah, hold on.

Let me just finish the statistics on it. They claim there are 169 billionaires in california So this wouldn't impact a lot of people and they estimate the wealth tax would generate over 22 billion We've already seen elon and it won't You know, that's a static analysis That's such a stupid analysis because it's completely Keith's left Elon they're all gonna leave they're all gonna leave look I've talked to a lot of people I've talked to a lot of people about the the wealth tax who would be subject to it Okay, every single one tells me the same thing which is if california passes this this is a red light for me I'll leave the state every single one.

So Exactly same thing. Yeah. Yes, you're not going to raise 22 billion from this You're gonna raise it's actually gonna lead to a decrease in tax revenue because so many of these people are gonna leave The state and they're going to take investment with them their businesses with them their job creation with them Um, it's gonna actually more than half the tax revenue in the in the state of california It comes from the what is it the top 1% is that the statistic? It will kill the california economy Now, here's the crazy thing about it Probably the most crazy part of that whole wealth tax proposal and by the way Even if you support a wealth tax at the federal level It's stupid for california to do it on its own because it's very easy for you to leave california You just move some other part of the united states much much harder to leave the united states So the idea that like california can just do this on its own is like the height of stupidity by these by these legislators So the stupidest part of the whole bill is that there's a 10 year look forward Which basically says that if you spend any time in california, we're going to try and tax your wealth for the next 10 years So that means that for all of us thinking about this concept If we think this wealth tax might pass in the next 10 years We might need to leave the state now We might need to get get ahead of the curve and i'm hearing people now debating whether they should leave the state Because they think it's inevitable that something like this passes and the sooner they sever their nexus with the california The less likely they are to be roped into it.

So just the mere fact they're proposing this bill I don't think they're gonna get the votes in this legislator There's a six democrats have already come out against it. So I don't think it's gonna pass this year or next year But the fact that they're even putting it on the table is making a lot of people Second guess whether california is the place they want to create their businesses And what we really need is for the governor gavin newson to come out right now and say listen Like this is a bad idea. I will veto it.

I will not you know support this if i'm governor for the next, you know, five six years And um his mere failure to come out and say what he really thinks about this is hurting the state Because a lot of people are already contemplating. Do I need to leave now? Sax, let me ask a philosophical question. Do you think that this um Kind of speaks to a broad challenge with democracy as I kind of tried to point out earlier Which is at some point The majority can take things away from the minority by just passing a law by voting And when you make that vote the majority of people aren't affected.

Therefore, they'll say sure Let me I mean, I know that you know, you you have more background in this than the rest of us But like what is the political science principle here on how democracy kind of protects itself from having the majority Eat the minority when the minority, you know In in this particular case Funds the state's budget right and well, there's there's a famous and the voter doesn't see that Yeah, there's a there's a famous line in political philosophy that democracy is not two wolves and a sheep voting on what they're going to have for dinner Okay, that there's a concept There's a concept in addition to democracy of rights, you know that that you have rights that the government can't just take away And so part of the american founding wasn't just sort of the majority and machinery of government It was a preoccupation with with the rights of individuals and minorities to be protected Against what majorities would do.

That's why we have the bill of rights um, so yeah, I mean There have to be rights of individuals that are protectable on some level and I and I think it's a real constitutional issue Whether the wealth tax is even allowed Well, that's a thing. That's I think where it's going to get fought and lost because the the clever Order in the supreme court will say if this what comes next is it are we going to go back and saying, you know All of a sudden the majority doesn't like certain kinds of other kinds of minorities Where it is a lot and you can't you can't have a certain kind of car or house you can't have a certain car Oh, wait, I actually don't like the tone of the color of your skin.

Oh wait religious minorities all of a sudden we're back to the 1940s and I just don't think this is going to pass because it's not um Justifiable at the federal level. I do think that you can just basically jack up taxation and do a bunch of other things that That make it more fair. I'll be honest with you guys. I'm a little torn on this topic and I'll tell you why On the one hand if I had to pay one and a half percent a year. I'm like, okay What is the marginal utility of that money for me? It's basically zero So it's not as if I would feel that change of 1.5

percent The thing that would upset me more is not having to pay the 1.5 percent But then to see it wasted that would drive me crazy because then I would think, you know, I could have bought potable water for you know A native indian tribe in california. I mean actually here's a perfect example I just found this out today. You guys would be shocked. There is an incredible shortage of clean water in the central valley There are places today where you're and my fellow compatriots of california live where they have to buy these huge 12 dollar arrowhead jugs of water Because the water is completely poisoned And when I heard that yesterday, I thought in california in the united states of america And then he said to me chmath you can give for two and a half million bucks.

You can basically get 5000 people clean water Through this thing that he's working on So for me the thing that would be upsetting is not paying The 1.5 percent it would see it would be seeing nothing get solved from it And then and then what it would really prove is what I said earlier, which is it's just a bunch of belly aching From folks that actually just don't know How to actually seek success and that's the thing to moth is that you can run for the governor of the state of california and fix that problem That is the benefit of democracy is you know You can kind of run and you can step in and you can help solve these problems at the government level But we could start a podcast and try to use our influence or we could donate to things guys I'll say something else I also think that these kinds of bills are actually a shot across the bow to a handful of people That are not playing by the rules anymore We're not towing the line and standing in line and saying i'm clearly demarcating myself as a democrat I'm clearly demarcating myself as a republican or play nice because think of what's really happened in in in covid You've had a massive explosion in D to c distribution Right think of the platform that we've created out of nothing think of the platform that elon musk has out of nothing And if you if you take that writ large, it's extremely disruptive to people who Is all about controlling the message which allows them to control power And I think that a lot of these rules are these ways of almost like counter punching against it But they're ineffective I what I would encourage all of us to do is actually become completely zen And instead continue to aggregate distribution power because that will replace the one and a half percent tax that you have to pay Because if you can talk to people directly and tell them your version of the truth and allow them to underwrite Their version of the truth against what you said that is modern power And that's worth a lot more than the money that you'll pay Now would you give that same power to donald trump because he's been cut out Um, I think you have to in that model All right, everybody We'll be taking next week off Because it's spring break and you can take the week off as well anybody have any plugs or things they want to promote Why are we taking the week off? Because I don't want to take the week off.

I'm fine with doing it. I think some people are going to be on vacation in there Someone's going to be somewhere really nice Can't you call in chumath can't you call in what's going on? I don't know if the place chumath is going to be has internet access We'll send you a starlinked. We'll get you along to send you a starlink all of my All of my undisclosed locations have internet access for those of you who don't know chumath has rented the pyramids in guiza And he will be staying inside of them and he'll be dismantling them and nfting them and turning them to dust I'll be sleeping and I will be getting wrapped as a mummy and king tuts tomb.

He has robotic waiters serving him the whole time He's there. He's living out of sci fi fantasy next week. So enjoy well, you know what? I did tweet that we're going to do a live show after everybody gets vaccinated We've been doing over three million a day here in california starting tomorrow april 1st life poker Life poker can occur, but we are going to be hosting. I think chumath and i New york city New york city sacks is partial to miami Because it's elf wager. Is that right am I I don't know are you? Wait jason can we do jason can we just can we just agree then let's do this guys let's do may We'll do it uh Some somewhere in new york city and then june we can do miami.

How about that? Well june is going to be too hot I would I would flip that and I would because because it's going to be too hot and Maybe better but also I'll tell you the other reason to city tour well we could do both but I also think that we should do miami first because they're not afraid to come out to an audience I think that people in new york and california still have they have more ptsd. We need to go where people are the most reckless I agree. Let's go where people have absolutely Totally gone yolo.

I mean Just to close on this freedberg as the uh, you know man of science here on the on the pod At this point these vaccines have been proven to not only keep you from dying keeping you out of the icu We now found out this past week correct that you're not going to carry it and infect other people in all likelihood very true and Another sorry. Sorry. Sorry. We what happened? Yeah, and another interesting point was made this week by paper That was published showing that you have effectively 80 percent efficacy from your first shot Uh about two to three weeks after your first shot and then you go to 90 after your second shot And then there's another paper that showed you're actually better off waiting Over three months for your second shot not getting it three weeks later You were right.

You said we should do one shot and then come back to the second And so there's now there's now very good data that shows that that would have been a better move because we would have had Double the throughput in terms of how many people we could have gotten shot in arms if we had done that So everyone effectively gets 80 90 protected or 80 protected after the first shot And then it's better to wait three months And so we could have done the back half of the year where everyone gets their kind of booster a second shot And the front half of the year give the whole united states a first shot, but David David what's the where's the article that says you don't carry it if you've gotten the vaccine? I need to know that because that's like the thing that's always in the back of my mind.

Yeah I tweeted it. I tweeted it I think I ratioed it my ratio I see you I see you're retweeting some of my ideas. You know because I love you Okay, because I'm your friend and I fucking love you. You usually you usually say back something you will say back at some point I don't know what I have to do for you. Yeah, I mean I mark I mark up your deals. I you know, I take care of your family I mean, I'm here for you. You did mark up that pipe deal that pipe deal has gone supernova with that chamath Pixie dust on top of it Experts say it appears COVID 19 vaccines can help reduce the transmission of the new Coronavirus from person to person to say this is accomplished by reducing the viral mode In a vaccinated person's nose besides the statistics on this You know, there is no documented proof that someone was fully vaccinated and transmitted COVID to someone else Um out of 400 million total vaccinations globally.

So there's a you know, also like a really strong kind of point to make Which is show me the evidence that it can because you know everything about biology and you know Science would would indicate you know in terms of how this would work There's no reason the virus should be spreading and that you suddenly become infectious and contagious of course that you can't be infected with This is like the most obvious study ever that look if you get the vaccine it prevents you from getting sick You're also not going to transmit it to other people But let me ask a question.

Why is it that every time a politician? Says that the experts required it. It's always the stupidest position You know because the experts on this show we had freeberg saying this stuff We had bob bob walker from usf who you know runs usf saying that you know We should have just done the first dose first get everyone through on one dose and then come back into the second dose Of course like no one in the federal government a position of authority took that position Fauci didn't take that position and then we had Fauci on top of it saying that we might have to wear masks until 2022 But you know because because because of this like asymptomatic because you could be vaccinated and sold spread it Which has now been totally Disproven so why is it that whenever somebody says we have to listen to the experts? They're always listening to the stupidest David David We are in a culture where independent thought is not valued Where it is better to abdicate and look to an expert to tell you what to do now that is again I go back to we are in a cultural malaise of not wanting to make a room.

I've been working on my doctor Fauci sacks Mr. Sacks, that's correct Asymptomatic patients by the way in fact infect other people, but we don't know yet So it's best to wear a mask if not two masks and to have proper By the way, Chimot the point you just made I think is really important because I think it also reflects what I said earlier about economic inequality and An economic progress when you have greater economic freedom You have greater economic progress and then you will inevitably have economic inequality the same is true with ideas So when you give people the opportunity to have the greatest freedom in terms of sharing and expressing their ideas You have the greatest progress But you also end up with this offer this issue where people have vastly different ideas and inequality arises And right now we're in a mode of cancel culture and we're in a mode of telling people that they can't say certain things And they have to be very careful about you know What they're saying and what context and it limits this ability for people to feel free to express themselves Share their ideas and push the boundary and push the envelope and find the truth and find the best outcome And so I do think that we're in this kind of rationalization kind of stage of our democracy where we're We're reducing our our kind of degrees of freedom and it's it's playing out in terms of the ideas forum and the economic forum Um, and it just feels very resonant to me that both are very very linked right now Can can I try to answer my own question actually? Yeah, never stopped you before Here here's here's what I just realized okay Listen if you're going to make an argument that fundamentally makes sense You don't need to tell people.

Oh go follow the science. You don't need to appeal to some external authority You can just lay out your argument and it makes sense When do you need to say to everybody listen? You need to shut down your own brain? You just shut down your own logical thought process and just follow what that person over there says The people who need to make that argument are the people who are making arguments that don't make any sense I mean this idea of wearing a mask after you've already been vaccinated never made any sense This idea of locking down the whole economy instead of isolating the at risk people for a whole year It doesn't make sense.

It's been done David. It's been done by the left and it's been done by the right in equal measure Whenever you have an opportunity to grab power people will abstract And then they will aggregate and pull it in and they will make decisions for people by pointing to these abstract ideas It has happened in forever. This is not a new thing. It's just that now with social media You can distribute this power grab More efficiently than before and then you can see it for what it is because you can debunk it and that's the thing that's happened That's why there's more anger around it because you can debunk all this nonsense.

You can actually say well, what's the data say? and But most people don't want to do that. It's easier to abdicate responsibility. All right We want to thank dr. Fauci our great guest today. You want to maintain social distancing? Don't think for yourself the cdc has been very clear the chinese report from the who approved by shijing ping says it did not come from a weapons laboratory We take you know what a good thing at his word. You know what you are. You're not even fouchy. You're you're that person What's your what's your name the great actress the comedian from snl? She's got blonde hair Oh, yeah, Katie mcdonald or something.

Yeah, Kate mcdonald doing fouchy. That's what you are You're like a babushka. You're like a babushka doll I just love that they have ten crews being done by that other woman It's like every time they want to troll the republicans. They okay guys freeberg freeberg dead ago. He's meeting. He's meeting in a friend Oh, what do you mean? Be careful. Oh, it got dirty. He got ugly Take that last part out nick. Beep the last part out. Yeah, that he's having dinner with Beep and beep. All right, we'll see everybody. Love you guys We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow What you're about be what you're be Be what we need to get
