So live from an undisclosed location with the sultry filter on Having a great hair day. Yeah, that is a good hair day for you great hair day my pal And your favorite CEO and Twitterer mr. Elon Musk, how you doing pal? I appreciate you coming to the event and coming zooming in What's new in your world? Well, let's see I guess right now I'm sort of debating the number of bots on Twitter On Twitter Currently I'd like to watch what I'm being told is that the there's just no way to know the number of bots It's like as unnoble as the human soul basically I Said like why don't try calling people but I haven't got a response, you know, like if you try calling people or something, you know No, I don't know but I think like that would be one of the things to do to say like Have you tried calling them as opposed to try to read the tea leaves here? That's like impossible, you know Obviously you can have an account that looks exactly like a human account or is being operated at where one person is operating a thousand accounts or something But that person can only buy one toaster that are gonna buy a thousand toasters So you care about like number of unique real people that are on the system It's extremely fundamental and anyone who uses Twitter is well aware that the the common the common threads are a full of spam spam scam and and It was just a lot of you know fake accounts.

So it seems beyond beyond reasonable for Twitter to claim that the number of Essentially the number of real said another way the number of real unique humans That you see making comments on a daily base on Twitter is above 95% That is what they're claiming. Does anyone have that experience? I? There's a bridge I'd like to sell you, you know You know You can buy the Brooklyn bridge What do you think it is what yeah, what's the I mean it's not 5% what is it? I think it's some number that is probably at least four or five times that number.

I'd say it at if you did sort of the the lowest estimate would be probably 20% and And this and this is a bunch of quite smart outside firms have done analysis of Twitter and Looked at the the sort of daily daily users and their conclusions also about is about 20% but that's a lower bound It's not an upper bound If you look at say The most liked tweets on Twitter So I I have the the honor of Having the most liked tweet of any living human This is Thank you everyone for liking my tweet Putting you some of the bots out there but That tweet is less than five million likes It's like 4.7

or something like that and that that that was the where I tweeted about That next time buying Coca Cola to put the cocaine back in Definitely, it's clearly something that the public really wants and You know Coca Cola corporations should really think about going back to their roots Coca Cola, I mean this this I guess is the reason why our grandparents could sort of walk 20 miles in the snow Because they had Coca Cola with cocaine this is real reason Anyway, that's that's that's literally the most popular tweet of any of any living human and But Twitter says that the daily monotone the sort of monetizable daily active users is 217 million So why would it be that the most popular tweet ever basically is only You know two two and a half percent of the entire user base this this seems a very very low number and And the most popular tweets generally are clustered around that sort of four million Like level so it's a sort of color like basically two percent or less than two percent of the daily active users And technically monetizable daily active users is how Twitter refers it.

So it just seems How is this possible? Surely there's something that maybe You know ten percent of people would like not merely two percent You know if you think about it Elon, there's a corollary on YouTube What do what's the total user base of YouTube and what have the most popular videos gotten there? Yes, and I think there's a billion or two maybe a billion people using YouTube and those the most popular videos have tens of billions of views Yes, that might be instructive Exactly that ratio makes a lot more sense so The something doesn't add up here And my concern is is not that is it like you know, is it five or seven or eight percent? But is it potentially? 80 percent or 90 percent but yeah, you know, is it I mean I certainly know there's some real people on Twitter But but what's if it is it an order of magnitude? Is it is it 50 percent instead of five and that's obviously an incredibly material number especially since Twitter relies primarily on brand advertising as opposed to specific click through advertising where you make a purchase if you make a purchase It doesn't really matter that much but for brand advertising, which is really just awareness advertising It matters if real humans are seeing that or not Yeah, and so I guess stepping back for a second people are curious why you want to buy Twitter Why is this so important to you and then I guess what are the chances you think the deal gets done at this point? So a two parter Why is it so important to me? I mean some of this I've articulated before but I think there's a need for a Public town square digital town square that where people can debate issues of all kinds Including the most substantive issues and in order for that to be the case You have to have something that is as broadly inclusive as possible that has as much of the people on the platform as possible where it's it feels Balanced from a political standpoint.

It's not biased one way or the other And where the system is transparent This is why I think it's important to put the algorithm on on GitHub and actually allow the public to see it and critique it and improve it And if there are any manual changes sort of shadow banning as it's called or Increasing or decreasing the prominence of a tweet that's done manually that that should be noted so you know what has happened and it's not just You know You're just where it is right now. We don't know what the heck is going on Why is one tweet doing well? Why is enough sweet not is it the algorithm that someone manually intervene? Why are some accounts banned? with no recourse apparently and You know the reality is That that Twitter at this point, you know has a very far left bias And I would class myself as a moderate and you know neither Republican nor nor Democrat And in fact, I have voted voted overwhelmingly for Democrats Historically overwhelmingly like I'm not sure I might never have voted for Republican just to be clear right now No, this election I will David you okay He's fine.

He's fine. We're gonna resuscitate him. We're gonna resuscitate David sacks. I mean let me ask you a person The point I'm trying to make is that this is not some sort of attempt to You know, it's not some right wing takeover as as pets say people in left may fear but rather a moderate wing takeover And an attempt to ensure that that people of of old You know political beliefs feel welcome on on a digital town square that and they can express their their beliefs without fear of being banned or shadow banned and And that we we obviously need to get rid of the bots and scams and trolls and people that are operating huge bot armies in an attempt to Unduly influence the public opinion so this is what I think it's very important that we have that like the the some of the smallest people in history have Thought about it and said like free speech is important for a for a healthy democracy.

It is important and free speech only matters Like say when does free speech matter most it's when someone when it's someone you don't like saying something You don't like That's when it actually matters so You know can't Obviously and and it's pretty annoying when someone you don't like says something you don't like that's that's that's bad But it's actually a good sign of That that you have free speech So I mean I get trashed by the media all the time. It's fine. I don't care Good do it twice as much. I couldn't care less But it's indicative of the fact that even though I you know, I have like a lot of resources I do not actually have the ability to stop the media from trashing me and that's actually a good thing Yeah, I have to ask With regard to this current administration.

I know how hard you work on the car company and then Biden You know, you've been a lifelong Democrat. You've donated to Obama and to everybody probably never voted Republican and yet And the same is true for Joe Rogan Joe Rogan is you know, Bernie Sanders supporter and that the Democratic Party has been openly hostile to Joe Rogan and Biden can't even say the word Tesla or invite you to the White House when they do an EV summit I'm curious just on a very personal basis. What does it feel like to have that experience where the party you supported? Is won't even say the name of your company or invite you there.

They should be celebrating the work you're doing Yeah, I mean it definitely feels like this is not right like this is The the issue here is that there's just this the the Democrat Party is overly overly controlled by the unions and by the trial lawyers, particularly the class action lawyers Um, and generally if you if you'll see something that doesn't that is not in the interest of the people Um, it's on the on the Democrat side. It's going to come because of the unions, which is just another form of monopoly and the the trial lawyers That that's where actions will be happening from the Democrat side.

They're not in the interest of the people and then to be fair on the Republican side There's there's if you say like where is something like not not ideal happening. It's because of corporate evil and religious deletry But that's generally where the bad things will be coming from on the Republican side that are not representative of the people so um, in the case of biden, he is simply too too much Captured by the unions, which was not the case with obama So in the case of obama, you could have you know, he was sort of quite reasonable And I think he took more of a view that you know, obviously you take the concerns of the unions into account But uh, they're they're bigger issues at stake and unfortunately biden does not do that Elon I have a have a tesla question.

I read today. It's incredible. There was a bloomberg article that said the following So the setup is this it said since you went public teslas up 22 000 percent Uh, 11 quarters of prof sequential profitability. So hitting on all cylinders but the public analyst We had cylinder Carjo that's a combust Fire we're stepping on the gas pedal firing But analysts, uh, when they put out their projections, okay It's it's one of the most enormous bands for any company in america the the price targets for tesla despite all of this success Some have it at 200 some have it at 1600.

It's all over the place. You tweeted Uh, a couple months ago teslas not a company. It's like six companies inside of a company like you've had to build Yeah, maybe more. Can you just explain to people All these companies inside the super company just so folks have a sense of what had to be done to get here Okay, I mean this this question requires thought and I'll probably be leaving out Quite a few things but if you look at say what what does a typical? car company do what they do is they they They they assemble vehicles Um, and they send them to dealers and they manage the supply chain Uh, the they might make the engine uh, typically will make the engine but most of the parts are made by suppliers Um, and a lot of the actual technology development is done by suppliers and most of the most of the vehicle software is done by suppliers So the actual amount of uh, real work done by car companies that what do you think of sort of like a gm of Ford is not actually that much Um, and but like so they don't do they don't do sales.

They don't do service. Um, They uh, so in the case of tesla, for example, we we do we do our own sales and service We don't have dealerships. Um, then uh, tesla also has by far the biggest network of superchargers sort of the electric equivalent of gas stations So we've built an entire global supercharger network, which is still the most advanced and by far the best Way to charge your car when traveling long distance or if you live in a city Um, and uh, and don't have the ability to charge your car. There's a street parking or an apartment So the whole supercharger network we developed the supercharger network.

We deployed it. I think we have I don't know 15,000 superchargers globally Um, you can travel anywhere in America right now with uh, the tesla supercharger network Um, then uh in terms of vertical integration Uh, we uh, we make the the battery pack, uh, the the power electronics the drive unit. Um, we uh, We actually make we're more integrated in the parts who actually make so much of the car, uh internally We're vertically integrated. Um, not necessarily because we think that there's some religious reason to be vertically integrated But because uh, the pace of what we needed to move was just much faster than the supply chain could move And to the degree that you inherit the legacy supply chain you inherit the legacy constraints including their speed cost and uh and technology And then tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company So the software that runs in tesla operates the car operates the screen Uh, does the charging uh, all of that stuff is developed by tesla And um, so we have sort of a car a tesla os in the car when you I've you're gone for a long time and then very importantly uh, tesla has built an an autopilot ai team from scratch That is the best real world ai team on earth.

Um, and if anyone else has got a better one, I'd like to see it demonstrated in a car um, the the full self driving beta at this point, uh Can very often take you with zero interventions across the bay area from san azade or marin So through complex traffic, it's really quite sophisticated. Um, and I'd invite anyone to to join the beta or look at the videos of those who are in the beta We've got like 100,000 people in the beta. So it's not tiny and we'll be expanding that to I don't probably a million people A million I don't know on that order by the end of the year.

So um, it's um You had this slide We also we also we also have a We also we also built a chip team to because there wasn't there wasn't hardware to that we could run the friggin ai on We couldn't just fill the trunk with a whole bunch of gpus and They would have taken a trunk full of gpus that would have been very expensive and take massive amount of power and cooling Just to be able to do what the tesla designed Full self driving computer can do So and we started a chip team from scratch designed it.

It was the best in the world and still is the best in the world several years later And we're also then developed we were designing a dojo super computer to be able to process the All the video that's coming in from billions of miles of data because just sort of like the way that that it's very difficult to compete with Google because they have so much data and they have all the people doing searches all the time and humanity is training it But the same is true of tesla. You really need billions of miles ultimately tens of billions of miles of training data combined with Sort of a vast training computer and then optimize inference hardware in the car And state of the art ai and training especially software across the board to be able to achieve a full self driving solution I When he opened tesla giga factory remember this six or seven years ago I'll just tell the audience a story quickly Elon.

He puts a slide up there and he says guys. We're not actually building A factory we're building a machine that makes machines and he puts the layout of the factory And it looks like a chip And it was basically like how you would actually lay out a microchip if you were or you know You were like a layout engineer. It was the craziest thing I'd ever seen. I was like that was when I first got it Yeah, you know you walk and tend and you see what's happening and you have an insurance company now You're doing insurance for tesla owners and an uber competitor right and eventually a robo taxi uber competitor.

All right, babe Yeah, I mean insurance is not quite significant now. Are you okay? I'm okay Because the car insurance thing is a bigger deal. I may seem a lot of people are paying You know 30 40 percent as much as their lease payment for the car in car insurance um, so the car insurance industry is incredibly inefficient because they're they're just Uh, first of all, you got like so many Um, sort of middle entities you've got you've got from the insurance agent all the way to The final sort of reinsurer. There's like a half a dozen companies each taking a cut.

Um, and then uh, the That it's all very statistical so that there's um, Even if you're a very good driver like you could be like, you know 20 years old and a great driver, but they it's all statistical so you can't get you either can't get insurance or it's extremely expensive Um, so but tesla allows for real time insurance based on how you actually drive the car You can actually if you drive the car Safe away you actually Have lower insurance. So ours is is is insurance is based on how you actually drive not how You know, historically people that you know fit your whatever demographic have drive and then you can close the loop around your Uh insurance rate by simply driving better and looking at your score And and and lowering your assurance in real time and people do it actually promote safer driving I actually have had this experience because In my household two people drive my car and one of them has a 93 score and the other one Does not they have like a And um, you may have met this other person But uh, I've been trying to work with her on the aggressive turns and stops in advance of our insurance bill Uh, which we're hoping will go down at some point.

Um, you didn't oh the one question are Is this twitter deal going to get closed? Do you think there are chances here? Well, I mean it really depends on on a lot of factors here Um, I'm still waiting for uh, some sort of logical explanation for the number of sort of Fake or spam accounts on twitter Um, and twitter is is refusing to tell us. Uh, so You know This just seems like a strange thing Um, wait, sorry. Is are they refusing to tell you? You don't think they really know? I mean There's a good chance.

They may just have no idea They claim that they do know Yeah, and they claim that they've got this complex methodology Uh that only they can understand Um But the guy who landed two rockets We're just through we stir this cold run and then you throw the novel and um Pogsworth oil is well Suddenly this comes to you in a dream. I don't know um But there should be some uh, you know objective weight is so the uh thing because this is a this is a material public state threshold issue. Yeah, it you know, it's it's a you know, it's a material adverse misstatement, you know, if if if they in fact uh, have been um, vociferously claiming less than five percent of fake or spam accounts But in fact it is four or five times that number or perhaps 10 times that number This is a big deal.

Um, it's not this it seemed like if you said, okay Um, I'm gonna I agree to buy your house. You say the house has less than five percent termites That's that's an acceptable number. But if it turns out it is 90 percent termites. That's uh, Not okay, you know, it's not the same house. Um This house made mostly of perma Let's leave it literally your house will disappear because it's mostly made of two months Um, so you know that that would obviously just not be appropriate So in making the twitter offer I was obviously relying upon the the truth and accuracy of their public filings If those those filings are not accurate.

It's simply Not that that it's it's not you you can't pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed And you know, they say Elon life's a negotiation. So at a different price, it might be a totally viable deal, correct? I mean that I mean, it's not out of the question. Um, but I really would you know, this is you know, the more the more questions I asked the more I the more my concerns uh, grow um, so You know at the end of the day Acquiring it has to be fixable.

Um, and and fixable at we know with with reasonable time frame and without revenues collapsing along the way and all that sort of stuff And so You know, I I really like the idea that you know, I you know, I I really need to see how These things are being calculated and and it can't be some deep mystery that is like more complex than the human soul or something like that It's about to be you know I think we can apply the scientific method to this and try to figure out what's really going on and um Twitter's revenue is is primarily dependent I think 70 percent or some that order on brand advertising as opposed to specific purchase advertising This is a big deal because brand advertising is not there's not a there's not a purchase that results from that So it's basically, you know, how much mind share or like basically if you're a big company, how often do they hear your name? Um, it's as opposed to something that where you can directly measure the outcome Um, so that that means that they're somewhat going on faith Um, and if that faith is undermined or reduced because of the reality of the situation coming to the fore Then the the the Tesla's revenue or Twitter's subtlety Twitter's revenue Will be significantly impaired and that's a major problem Yilan, did you have a chance to ask these questions during your negotiation? Uh, the like I said, I was relying upon their their public filings So to the degree that like their product public fund, this is normal for a public company if you you know, if you make a formal filing That that is what investors are lying upon or lying on whether they are making an acquisition offer or simply buying some shares So this this this the accuracy of these filings is important whether you're buying one share or the whole company um, and so if these filings are inaccurate or if they're Sort of potentially blatant.

Yeah, it's a big deal Yilan, do you have a sense of why this has been such a persistent problem for twitter? Do they not have the technical capabilities to solve the the bot problem? Or is it more of like just uh, they've under prioritized the issue or been unwilling to because potentially there are implications for uh, add add add revenue I I I don't know it's sort of speculative at this point. So the you know the the uh, the worst interpretation would be that they don't want to look too closely at the thing because they might not like the answer That would be the worst interpretation But the best I'm not sure what the best interpretation is but the least bad interpretation would be Maybe they thought it was this way But they're the way they were doing it was wrong and they didn't realize they were mistaken and simply weren't paying enough attention Um, it does seem as though it should be a lot easier to get rid of the bots and spam and trolls Then uh, like this is not some we're not trying to split the atom here, you know I'm not trying to get to the moon.

Okay. I'm just trying to limit the amount of obviously scammy accounts It's if it's if it's like the bitcoin giveaway, um, you know probably it's it's a spammer, you know like it does Maybe you know wait, you're not giving away a hundred bitcoin I just sent you ten If if you send me two bitcoin, I'll send you one back. All right, that's my Actually, um, I thought one of the interesting things that came up in your product roadmap or I guess this was released and people covered it was the Um possibility of twitter becoming kind of a super app with Payments included um, maybe perhaps even doge or something.

This seems to me Based on your work with with david a paypal like a pretty brilliant idea What's what's the vision there in terms of if you were able to buy it, you know, perhaps at the right price? Um, what would it look like if you know, I could add jason to add elon musk, you know 10 bucks or something if you know, we were splitting a check or something Sure. Well For those that have used we chat, I think that's we chat's actually a good model. Um, if you're in china It's basically you kind of live on we chat.

It does everything It's sort of like twitter plus paypal plus a whole bunch of other things and all roll into one with actually a great interface And it's it's really an excellent app And we don't have anything like that. Um outside of china. So I think it such a such an app would be really useful. Um, and it just like the utility of it of sort of a Spam free thing where you could you can make comments you post videos you can Uh, you know, I think it's important for content creators to have a revenue share Um, now this this does not need to be done on twitter.

It could be done from something that's cratered from scratch So it could be something new. Um, so really but but I think this thing needs to exist whether it is uh converting twitter to be the sort of like Kind of all encompassing app that that like said everything from digital town square were important ideas are debated Uh, you know, I'm actually trusted and inclusive and at a point where you're you sort of have a high trust situation then then payments uh, uh, whether it's uh, crypto or fiat Uh can make a lot of sense Just we just want something that's incredibly useful and that people love using um, so But it's it's either convert twitter to that or start something new those are the two But it does need to happen somehow Well, it's interesting you bring that up because the price of twitter Is pretty high and you've built a couple of companies and some engineers like to come work for you Um, and you've now gone through the intellectual exercise of studying all this Um, if you're looking at the two choices now fixing twitter given all these problems and maybe just starting Your own version Which one are you leaning towards because it I have watched you build a couple of companies and the products have turned out pretty good So is it easier for someone like you to just start from scratch? I mean I mean, it's certainly the My my default inclination is to start things from scratch Uh, I mean, I'm not really I don't buy things like there's still this put sort of, you know Um Yeah, like like spacex was started from scratch You know in the case of tesla, uh, you know It was like five people if it's still the sky ever hard Who's the worst guy I've ever worked with who tries to claim like so credit essentially for creating tesla And if he's so damn great, why don't you just go? You know create another car company when he was fired Um, but anyway Um, so I mean that's a pretty good story.

I mean, yeah I remember because he's a sad I mean no, but I remember having this conversation with you We were having a conversation about the roadster. I think I can tell this story. I said how's it going pal? And you said well I got one problem Um, it turns out the roadster parts and putting it together cost 190,000 Yeah, and I said I gave you 150 for number 16. So if you make 2000 of these you're gonna lose 80 million dollars And you were like, yeah or double that. I mean they basically The parts of the car cost more than they were selling it for when you were starting to get involved That's it was this Well before that yes When twitter went when tesla was nothing but a piece of paper.

Let me be crystal clear crystal fucking clear No, they didn't bring me in Either I was gonna start I was gonna start an eb company with jay v struggle And based on the the ac propulsion t0 And when I when I asked ac propulsion if it was okay to do that They said well, there's also some others who want to create an eb company, but have not created one yet Yes, would you like to join forces with them? And I said, okay? Well, we'll do that. That was a huge mistake JB and I should have just started the car company ourselves instead We teamed up with everhard topening and right big mistake The the the actual moral error here was me trying to have my cake and eat it too Which is like I just want to work on the technology and the product and have someone else be the CEO and Sort of run the business operations because I just like working on technology and product design and And and also I was like doing spacex You know at the time in Iraq, so blowing up so it seemed like okay.

This is like I always wanted to an electric car company This is how I can have my cake and eat it too. That was a huge mistake and fundamentally a moral error and so so In the end I had to freaking be CEO and I didn't want to be basically So but it's either that or the company's gonna die so so we started with really just nothing and the You know the the tzero prototype from ac propulsion not not it that's the that's the precursor to tesla Yeah, there was one half sinker clear once again When we created tesla when I when I joined there were no no employees.

There was no intellectual property There was no prototype. There was no nothing Yeah To be crystal fucking clear and And It almost bankrupted you. I mean you that sent you to the cliff of I mean that was yes. We were on the ragged edge of bankruptcy so many times. It was ridiculous So um, I want 2008 was one of the worst years where basically the You know gm and for just a jm jm and price so Ford almost went bankrupt and You know trying to raise money for a startup electric car company in 2008 while gm is going bankrupt was difficult to say the least You know people were angry that I even asked them for my Like fuck you and hang up So the only way that that that tesla actually made it through 2008 was a subset of the existing investors um, which includes like people like antonio grasius and uh, you know, um, Steve jovitz and and a few other key people our erin price uh Who who I've hold a debt of gratitude to the state? Um, and and I I put in all the money I had left and they said everything literally everything.

Um, I didn't even have a house. Uh, so Uh, this is my xyp. So I've had the house. So I was like staying actually in jeff skulls bedroom spare bedroom And and but there was the that uh The subset of the investors would say okay, I put in they're putting as much as I put in so I put in everything Um, and and then we closed that round 6 p.m. Uh christmas eve 2008 It was last hour of the last day that it was possible because after that people were like have breaking for the holidays And we would have bounced payroll two days after christmas It was uh pretty that's doorstop.

I mean it was an incredible moment in time and people also forget at the time That the first two rockets spacex sent up Didn't exactly make it to orbit like one of those three at the first three and I remember having dinner with you at that time and I asked you hey, how's it going? I heard uh, you gawk or says you got four weeks of payroll left and you said that's not true And I said thank god and you said we have two SpaceX and Tesla in 2008 if we'd simply paid our suppliers on time we would have gone bankrupt immediately Tell us tell us actually uh It was it was a pretty crazy moment time because I also remember asking you at we were having dinner at boa and I said Well, certainly it's got to be some good news And you took out your blackberry to date the conversation.

I don't remember it Oh, yeah And you said don't tell anybody jay callas. No problem. And you showed me the clay version of the model s Yeah, the most beautiful car I'd ever seen and I said oh my god, it's stunning. Um, how much is it going to cost? You said I think I can make it for 50,000. I remember it was yesterday. I said if you make that car for 50,000 You'll change the fucking world and you did it And I was a little more than 50,000 but Has your Let's ask about spaces. Okay.

Well, that's what's basic But I want to ask one more personal question has life gotten Easier for you as these companies have hit scale or has the complexity made life Even more challenging because those early days it was just fighting to survive Nobody knew who you were you were anonymous And it was really just about the work and now Let's face it. You're the world's most famous guy And everybody's watching everything you do, but these companies are also very big. So what's life like for you today? Are you enjoying what you're doing every day? Um, well, I mean, it's it's somewhat of a roller coaster.

Um, so they're like good days and bad days Um, and there's there was a crisis issues um, and you know like sort of you know knock on wood like we're not like Facing, you know death in the face like it's it's definitely like quite stressful when like, you know death is like Trying to eat your face off and like the foam is like, you know, just kidding and like yeah Right there, you know No, that's it's pretty stressful in that situation. Um so like right, you know, both SpaceX and Tesla have um, You know significant cash reserves.

So like, you know, it's not we're staring death in the face We could sort of see it over in the horizon, you know, so I don't want to get complacent or entitled because um, but but if it's not like just sort of foaming at the mouth and gnashing trying to eat your face off on a daily basis that's That's certainly we've moved on from that point. Um, and hopefully never never return. Um But but there are a lot of issues that need to be it's just Like the if you're a CEO of a company the chore level is high and if you don't do your chores Then the company goes to hell and I hate doing doing chores frankly.

So uh, who do who does? Uh, so that's the real like there's a whole bunch of sort of uh, you know personnel issues and legal issues and and and things that I I don't find enjoyable to work on but if I don't work on them the company suffers. So it's more like Just the sheer volume of work is insane. That's the uh, and then and then I you know, go do some go add to it with you know, Twitter or something like that. Um, I mean, honestly, I'm an extra processor. Yeah Yeah, I mean, I I have a habit of biting off more than I can chew and then just sitting there with like chipmunk cheeks And then just sitting there with like chipmunk cheeks Tell us uh, you know and tell us a little bit about where we are at SpaceX like how You fund the ability to go to mars, but then also commercially still build Uh a conventional space business domestically.

I think this russia thing was probably really good for SpaceX if you want to just tell us a little bit about that um, sure, um, will the the I mean the goal of SpaceX is to develop the technology that enables life become multi planetary. Um, and that you know and make humanity a space firing civilization, which I think is very exciting inspiring thing and it's like some one of those things where you can that that I think Just makes kids like be excited about the future And and we need things that are inspiring and exciting and make the future seem like it's going to be better than the past Life can't just be about solving one miserable problem after another.

It's got to be like like what's what's inspiring and exciting And I think that a future where we are space firing civilization Is is one that we can all get excited about And and we can go out there and find out what what's what's out there in the universe and what's the meaning of life and You know, where are the aliens and hopefully they're friendly So uh You know, it's interesting. I do get asked about the aliens question a lot and I've I've not seen any evidence of aliens And I'll I'll be the first to you know, tweet about it or whatever if I if I see something I mean, you'll tell us if you find them.

I will tell you I will definitely tell you if there's aliens and You know, uh, I think it would be quite helpful for you know Like like if we found aliens like probably spacex would get a ton more revenue because people like oh man aliens We've got to upgrade our space technology pronto. It was what if you're on friendly, you know um, it's like, you know Uh, that is the idea that is the idea that you build Basically the ability to do orbital cargo take all those profits And move it all into building something that can get to Mars.

Is that the kind of rough plan pretty much it's if it was like a three step a three slide powerpoint it would be pretty much as you describe which is um, develop rockets that are that are capable of of taking uh, satellite store bits and crew to the space station Um, you know, basically servicing government commercial space launch in the space station commercial space launch needs, um, and then, uh Build a global communication system in space Uh that obviously it does a lot of good for earth but by providing uh internet Internet connectivity to the least served because the satellite system is really great for remote locations And you know countryside or or remote remote islands or or places where someone's trying to cut off their internet Uh As a prelude to a war we take down the internet system like in star wars.

Yeah Yeah, so it's like, you know, so it can be pretty pretty helpful Like I think like a sonic basically I think is a sort of forceful grid in its own right um by providing uh connectivity to the the the least served where they've got either no connection or a Very expensive or poor connection, uh, you know, um The like we're like we're connecting a lot of schools remote schools in brazil right now I'm actually gonna be gonna be headed there uh to sort of kick things off Um, but they've got a lot of schools that have no connectivity at all and in a modern age Uh, how do you learn with no connectivity? I mean you could I guess old textbooks and stuff, but it's really Um, you're at a huge disadvantage if you um have no digital connectivity.

Um, so I think there's just a lot of good that starling can do In it just by by itself, but but then the the revenue generated from starling is what can enable the commission of a permanently Crude base on the moon, which would be the next you know next step from apollo Which is like there's no not go there for a few hours and and then head back. Let's have a permanently occupied science station on the moon um, and we could also build some pretty epic telescopes on the moon That would enable us to learn more about the nature of the universe and figure out what's going on and maybe detect those aliens um, do you Do you um, do you think that there's enough profit in those businesses to fund all this or do you need? Wall street and other investors to come share the load with you Is kind of doing a mar as a partnership with the government does it need to partner with governments to get there? Um Well, I think technically it does not need to partner with governments um, but of course government support would be helpful so I mean, it's going to be very expensive to build a self sustaining city on mars like in order for us to become multi planetary in a way that's meaningful the the key threshold is um, at which point does the city become Self sustaining such that if the ships from earth stopped coming for any reason And it could be any reason could be world war three or it could be just you know civilization subsided and And just gradually got to crap it or something But if the ships stop coming if the resplice ships from earth stop coming to mars for any reason Does the city still survive? And that's that's like really a large base of resources that are that that that are needed on mars You can't be missing any one critical ingredients Uh, so and and you think of this like there are these various great filters Um, you know that that perhaps stops civilizations Um, and one of the great filters is will we become a multi planet species or not? Will humanity be one of those? Species that passes the great filter of going beyond one planet and being a multi planet species And this is certainly something we will have to do at some point because this the sun is expanding and will eventually boil the oceans Um and destroy all life on earth.

So if you care about life on earth, you should really care about life becoming multi planetary and ultimately multi stellar because otherwise you're basically saying you're signing the sort of death warrant for all life as we know it It's it's inevitable and then there's also the the various things that kill of the you know the dinosaurs and and I mean you look at the fossil record. There've been five major extinctions Uh, that are sort of on the order of 80 90 90 percent of all creatures on earth dying Um for for a wide range of reasons um, but uh, and then humans can also you know with us the world war three danger that were that that other creatures didn't have where we could do ourselves in Um by sort of misusing advanced technology and and sort of just you know having some radioactive hellhole that's all that's left after world war three.

So um, you know, you one you could even characterize it potentially as which will come first world war three or Uh life becoming multi planetary on mars um, you know, yeah, sorry, I was going to shift but um, you know, when you think about the importance of going to mars versus solving critical energy and climate change problems here on earth, obviously the effort with teslas related to sustainable energy And I think going back to like probably the 1950s there were engineering designs around plasma fusion or fusion based systems that have evolved to these plasma systems to these tokamak systems And every year every decade it's like hey next decade.

We're gonna have it. What's your point of view? On where plasma fusion systems are are we gonna have fusion energy? This century this decade and does it create limitless energy where the Electricity production goes up by 10,000 fold and the price of electricity drops by 10,000 fold And then what does that world on earth look like if that happens? I guess question is like is that technology real? When does it happen and what happens to the world here when and if that happens? I'll answer that question, but then I'll let me sort of point out what the actual issue is If question is like, uh, is it possible to solve fusion energy? 100% yes, definitely definitely definitely definitely is for sure.

So the and and and really just using a tokamak style, which is like it basically a donut ring with Electromagnets that control the the plasma The way to solve that is simply scale up the tokamak fusion is very much a scale Based thing you want to minimize your surface volume ratio. So as you scale up A tokamak you reduce your surface volume ratio, which means like the the the volume you have relative to the surface You now have much more Like you can basically have a hot zone in the center. That's relatively far away from the walls and and more of a hot zone So the the So it's not in my mind a question as to whether each fusion can work But there is a question as to whether it is economically viable And and whether it is competitive with uh with with alternatives I think the the economic viability of fusion is a much bigger question and I I think the answer probably is that uh, a fusion Uh, if fusion is not competitive economically, I think that is that is uh I would say it's probably not competitive economically by an order of magnitude What does it break? Where does it break? Is it a materials breakdown or where does it break down? Economically well, so so you can't just um Use uh Normal hydrogen, you know, you need to use like deuterium and tritium like unusual forms of hydrogen helium three uh, you know, there um, there are some some other types of of fusion that could be used, uh, but Um, these are just not they're not like there's not a lot of this raw material.

It's quite difficult to get the raw material So first you have to get the raw material Uh, that's that's a expensive raw material um, and then, um, it's not just about generating the the energy you've you've got to um Turn that energy into usable electricity You can't just have a hot thing. Okay, so the hot thing has to translate to usable electricity So I think you've got you've got a cost of a fuel issue, which is very significant Uh, you've got you've got how a whole bunch of knockdowns from uh, when you generate the heat to uh, when you actually convert that into electricity Um, you've got some very difficult maintenance issues with with a fusion reactor Um So, uh And that should be then compared to alternatives.

Uh, the the sustainable energy alternatives that I think are overwhelmingly more competitive are um solar energy wind geothermal hydro Some tidal and energy, but it's really primarily solar and and wind Now you can really say like what why bother creating Uh fusion on earth when we have a gigantic fusion reactor in the sky that just works with zero maintenance And it shows up every day Pretty consistent. Yeah, but Elon can we scale to a thousand x or a hundred x our electricity production here using solar and other renewable sources? yes, so the amount of uh, surfs air you need to uh power the united states is remarkably tiny Um, so you need like basically roughly 100 miles by 100 miles of territory and it's obviously just need to be in one place In the united states to power the united states It's like a little corner of texas or utah the entire country um, and and then if you if you You could you could basically power uh, you you probably 10x the just with solar alone Um without displacing uh anyone's home Um power and economy 10 times the size of the united states in the united states On land what when energy prices if you extend that to if you extend that to water Because earth is 70 water.

Yeah, I mean you could you could say okay now we could probably have A civilization that is 100 times as energy intensive as we currently have it And so what does that look like was the last part of my question? Which is a world where energy costs are say let's 100 times cheaper than they are today and we have 100 times more energy production capacity What what changes about civilization? What do we do differently and what do we see? change most kind of dramatically well currently we're not Because of just generally uh low birth rates almost worldwide Uh civilization is not headed to Have a population that is the order of magnitude rather than where we're currently we're currently headed towards a population decline Uh, and this is almost everywhere in the world um, so You know it basically seems as as though as soon as you have like organization And and education be on a certain level and income be on a certain level birth rates plummet Um, and so as countries get get wealthier their birth rates plummet It's it's somewhat counterintuitive because people will say like well, it's too expensive to have a baby Nope, the the wealth there the are the fewer kids you have um, the more educated you are the fewer kids you have so Um, it's it's it's it's the it's the inverse um So so I'm not sure who to use all that energy Unless there's a significant change in the birth rate Or we have a very robot oriented economies.

That's also possible. So if we've got a lot of um, you know four wheeled robots in full of cars and Androids Humanoid robots then you can certainly see that there'd be perhaps a need for an order of magnitude more energy But it's not coming from the humans unless something Major changes on the on the human birth rate Level this by the way is I think the biggest single threat to civilization. Uh right now is the why why do you think societally? People just make those decisions when they become more affluent. Is it that they just become more selfish or there's More things for them to do and they have more money to spend on themselves and they say, you know what? I don't want to have a large family.

I want to You know go to Coachella Yeah, well There is this like weird like mind virusy thing where some people are Think like having fewer kids is is like better for the environment. Yeah, that's crazy total nonsense Nonsense the environment is going to be fine. They're going to be fine even if we if we doubled the size of the humans Um, this is and I know a lot about environmental stuff. So, um, you know, uh You we can't have civilization just dwindling to nothing. Um And you know, Japan's leading indicator here like the Japan's population declined by 600,000 people last year that lowest birth rate in history Uh, it's you know, it's pretty bad.

Um So I don't know I think So this one element of this is a lot of people just think that having kids is somehow bad for the environment I want to be clear. It's not it's essential for the main for maintaining civilization that would at least maintain our numbers We don't necessarily need to grow dramatically, but at least let's not uh, you know gradually dwindle away and until civilization ends with us all in adult diapers and And in in a whimper like we don't want civilization to end in adult diapers with a whimper that would suck Bleak Bleak and sad.

Well, I mean and you and I have had this conversation I mean in in Japan I had two people tell me when I was there like I think it's immoral to bring humans into the world I mean people have gotten very Sad about the future. It's kind of crazy. The world's great life Yes, no, there's there's literally I've heard many times how like how can I bring a child into this terrible world? I'm like, have you read history because let me tell you it was way worse back then Okay, yeah Now's a good time Hey, you know, listen, I I know you're super busy, but I want to ask you about the move to texas because I've been thinking about it austin california I don't know some senator told you to go fuck yourself and like You know like we don't need you here.

There's been a couple centers with that actually Yeah, it seems to be turning into a bit of a trend. Um, but how has building the tesla Gigafactory which I got to see in austin a couple weeks ago and it was one of the most inspiring things I've ever seen. I mean I don't know how many months it took to build there, but How long did it take to build that dread knot and then? What would have taken to build that in california california under gabin nuisim? so we built the The giga texas which is the biggest factory in north america.

I think possibly the biggest factory in the world Um, and it's three times the size of the pentagon to give you a sense of scale. Okay. This is friggin big It's like it's weird. It's like so big. It's weird like you It's like I was trying to find you in it and I was trying to drive around and it took me about 45 minutes to find you Yeah, like no you have to like call so you can't like find someone in the building you have to call them on their cell phone And say where are you, you know? um, so uh, I mean the building is like, uh Just under a mile long and we're actually going to extend it.

It will be like literally a mile long Um, and about a quarter mile wide Uh, and it's uh 80 feet tall So it's just uh ridiculously big um And when you think about it like for a manufacturing situation like what what what are the two the two things that really define manufacturing competitiveness are economies of scale and technology And so if you've got an ace on a con like if you sort of maximize your ace level on on technology and you maximize your ace level on scale This is obviously going to be the most competitive situation and that's why they're so friggin giant um and the the the a gigatexus will go all the way from um cell raw materials like like like basically rail cars of cell raw materials coming in and then forming the the battery cell then the battery pack building the the the motor Casting we also have introduced a major innovation, which is to cast the entire Front third and rear third of the car as a single piece I got this idea from toys actually because I was like, how do they make toys? Those are cheap.

They just cast them and I was like, well, can you pull the casting machine? That big and they're like, well, no one ever has I'm like, is it are we breaking physics? Like no Well, let's just ask them and there were six major casting machine suppliers in the world and five of them said no and the six said maybe I'm like, I'll take that as a yes I mean this you wanted to do this for the model three, but it was just too soon, huh? And and now it's almost there Yeah, actually this this partly comes from the model three, which is actually a fantastic car in many ways But we were rightly criticized for an inefficient design with for the front and rear body Like sandy Monroe, who I think is really has excellent from an engineering standpoint and and really a very fair critic He pistol wept us for The design of the the battery Apart and piece by piece told you why you suck and then you get the why and told you why you're awesome It took it apart and tells us exactly why he's why we sucked and he was correct and then And I was like, well, that's pretty embarrassing.

So No, he was complimentary of other parts of the carpet of the body design and and so it's like, okay, we're gonna go from like, you know The it's just incredibly difficult party to make it's made out of like 120 different pieces with dissimilar metals That are joined and you've got galvanic corrosion challenges. It's very difficult to make To a single piece casting that's one piece. So like 120 pieces went down to like one. So It's a it's a huge and And the like the model y body shop, especially the new one where we cast both the front and rear is 60 smaller than the model three body shop So it's you know Gigantic is quite a lot of innovations of Tesla besides the stuff that is is obvious Yeah So anyway, so yeah the and really, you know to refer to to Gavin Newsom like you know if you If you had a gun to Gavin's head, okay And said we need to build to stop building this factory in California right now He couldn't do it because there are so many regulatory agencies and so many Litigators in California that want to stop you from doing anything that even if you're the governor of the state you cannot get it done so something's got to be done to to you know, because California used to be the land of opportunity And it's a beautiful state and I love I loved living there I still spend a lot of time in California even though every time I go there I get Every literally every day I go there.

I get the bejesus tax out of big tax bill by day Yeah, like this year cost per day of me going and working in California days boggles the mind and I still do it, you know but but the California is going from the land of opportunity to to the land of of of sort of taxes over regulation and litigation And this is not a good situation and really this has got to be like A serious cleaning out of the pipes in California. How many months was it to get the giga austin done? It took a year and a half two years.

Yeah 18 18 months to build something three times the size of the Pentagon And you just basically the answer to how many months it would take in infinity we would still be working on the permits yeah This begs a good question, which is I'm not exaggerating One more form for you. What's a better model? Yes, what's a better model for government? So, you know, like all governments tend to increase in complexity dictatorship capacity Is the dictatorship the right model? and You know like like how do we solve this? Let's say you go to mars or let's say you have to fix california.

Is california permanently broken? Is there a way to fix it or like how do you set up a better model so that you don't end up having this this kind of special interest complexity situation that eventually kills the population well, I mean, I think ultimately with california the people of california just have to get fed up and demand change That's the thing that really has to happen And and and there's got to be an above zero percent chance of the of the republicans winning in california If if if it's just the democrats every time You've got to be Yeah, and this is this is like occasionally The thing is that right right now you And plus the level of level of gerrymandering, which is basically just treating the people like sheep and and it's terrible That's gone on in california is outrageous.

So california the dems have a supermajority In the house and senate in california and the governor and everything and so how responsive is any political party going to be to the people If they are guaranteed to win It's great. It's a one party state and so I'm not saying that you know go Sort of elect the republicans every time but if it's never You're you're just making california one party state They will no longer be responsive responsive to people and will only be responsive to those that funded their political campaigns Clip elon saying that 30 seconds on tv over and over go ahead sex.

Yeah, so elon shifting gears to the economy You know, we saw this surprise report of negative 1.4 gdp growth in q1 Interstate's been rising that increased the cost of the consumer of getting loans things like that We've had a stock market correction really a crash in a lot of growth stocks software stocks What from where you said and the data that you see Where do you think the economy is is headed right now? Do you think we're in a recession or is it just a risk? How do you how do you assess our current economic situation? Well predicting economic record economics is always difficult and one should assign probabilities to these things Um, but ironically I did last year people asked me what I think about the economy.

I said, well, I think we might enter a recession and approximately a spring of 2020 of 2022 All that Yeah so uh, now the thing is that recessions are not necessarily a bad thing. Uh, they they you know, um Um, what I've now been through a few of them and what tends to happen is if you have um, Uh, a boom that goes on for too long you get misallocation of capital It starts raining money on fools basically it's like any any dumb thing gets money and I'm sure you've seen a few of those um, so At some point it gets just out of control and you just have a misallocation of of human capital Where people are doing things that are silly and and not useful to their fellow human beings Um, and and then those companies there needs to be sort of an economic enema if you will Um Everyone sort of shift uncomfortably in their seats.

Um, so I'm sorry, it's just visualizing it the economic I mean listen, it's got a literation um This too shall pass This too shall pass eventually the economic enema does its job It clears out the pipes if you will. Yes And um and and sort of the the bullshit companies Uh, go bankrupt and the ones that are doing useful products are prosperous. Um, and um, but there's certainly a lesson here that if one is making useful Part and and and doing has a company that makes sense Uh, make sure you're not running things too close to the edge from a capital standpoint.

They've got some capital reserves to last through Uh irrational times because in the in the past when there's been a recession It has gone. It's it's amazing. It's flipped like a light switch I mean, David, do you remember this one from the from the PayPal, you know ex PayPal base when when we Uh raised a hundred million dollars in march of 2000 and we literally we had The demand was so high we had people like VCs like just literally without even a term sheet wiring money into our account We'll send the term sheet later They literally were like we like sleuth out our our bank account number and wire money in and we're like where'd this come from and it's like oh So it was like there was literally firehosing money in march of 2000 And and then in april 2000 the market went into freefall And it went from money raising money was trivial to even good companies could not raise money in a month So it's just important to bear in mind like that you know, people almost went bankrupt in in 2000.

Uh, we came close But but thankfully we'd raised that that hundred million dollars in in march 2000 without which would be Could we were doing game over basically? Um, and we kind of saw it coming. So it's like we we got that the the x confined emojid done in like three weeks and raised a hundred million dollars because we all were like, oh, oh We see this coming to an end pretty soon and then a month later. It was like, you know a nightmare basically And and uh, anyway, so it's just important to make sure if you're a healthy company, you got some capital to get through things um and and and then what what's your costs and uh, if you if it is a recession which More likely than not it is a recession not saying it is but probably probably is um, then just uh Make what's your cash flow and get to positive cash flows as soon as you can.

Um, so um Yeah But I think we probably are The are in a recession and that that recession will get get worse Um, but you know, these things pass and then there will be boom times again um, so it'll probably be some some tough going for I don't know a year. Uh, maybe maybe You know 12 to 18 months is usually um, the the amount of time that takes for for the a correction to to happen um I mean, what do you guys think? Yeah, I David, uh, how do you feel about it? Yeah, I mean it feels like it started Um, you know what started as a slowdown earlier this year Um now seems like I mean technically I guess we need two quarters of negative growth to be in our session But it feels like we're in one feels like it started Um, you know the growth stock the software businesses that we invest in are for the canaries and the coal mine And there's a lot of a lot of dead canaries But I think it's not dead it's just it's just napping Wake up little birdie It's just stunned it's got stunned for a brief moment and and and it just it'll be fine.

Um Um, it sort of reminds me of the parrot that you know the pet shop sketch with the parrot with Monty Python. Monty Python Um Pining this parrot is pining for the fjords Hey, um, Elon a lot of it's been talked about as we wrap here and you've been incredibly gracious giving us so much time Thank you for that. Um A lot of talk about american exceptionalism over the last couple years waning And maybe this country had seen its best days And uh, we see the work you're doing and other people in this great country are doing and the debates we're having about the future And uh, yeah, china is doing pretty fantastic russia's on the ropes But it does seem like uh america is still producing Some of the greatest companies, uh, the world has ever seen some of the greatest innovations What are your thoughts on america and our future and what we need to keep this country and and this beacon of hope that You know four of the five of us were not born here, you know, two of you came from south africa and no three of you Three of you came from south africa one of you from can i don't know what to put in the from swelanka and from swelanka and Through canada via canada He came through canada too.

Yeah, I know It seems like that's the that's the way canada is a gateway. It is a gateway and How do we it's a well, I'm hinting at the answer here, but you know, it does seem like our immigration policy is absolutely insane And uh, maybe we need to keep collecting some of the great individuals that I get to share the stage with here and yourself We need to keep bringing great people to this country Why can't we get that in our heads that? Yeah It's talent recruitment. No, absolutely. I think uh, it's incredibly important that the united states be Like the destination for the world's best talent.

I mean you can think of this like like like a pro sports team if you want to win the league And and uh, you know, you want the best players on your team Now there are obviously a lot of Very talent people born in the united states but if you could add a few aces from uh from Outside the country to the team you're going to win the league Um, and and and here's the thing those aces actually want to work for your team. They don't want to compete against you They want to they want to be on team america and as it's like We have to like fight them off to not be on team america.

That's the crazy thing Um, and so it's like if you had some aces that that are different between winning and losing We should be like really recruiting them like you'd recruit like a star basketball player or football player That's what we should be doing Active recruiting Just like if you're a company that wants wants to succeed you actively recruit the best talent And then and and that's the way to win And and if if that stops happening america will stop winning And we have two administrations in a row biden and trump who don't want to let The greatest minds the most talented people into this country is absolutely insane I mean, I think give us this every day.

I think the reality is like actually anyone who who's gonna who wants to Work hard and beat and do useful things um, and in this, you know, uh, we we want in the united states Um, and it's not just people who are sort of intellectually strong, but it's just anyone with a with a strong work ethic You know if if they're coming from mexico or if they're coming from, you know, Europe or china wherever it's just if they're like gonna come here and crank hard and and contribute more than they take Hell yeah, I mean, that's just it's no brainer we have you been have you been disappointed in the similarities between biden and trump on this like maybe you could have expected it from trump because that was a rhetoric He needed to use to get elected But it's not as if biden has flipped the script and said okay, we're gonna go 180 degrees in the other direction He's kind of kept it the same Which has been really surprising actually man.

It's hard to tell what bite is doing if you're telling frank Yeah, like It's weak and at bernie's The real president is whoever controls the teleprompter, you know, it's like it's like The path to power is the path to the teleprompter You know like what because that's that he reads the teleprompter So, you know, I do feel like if somebody would accidentally lead on the lean on the teleprompter It's gonna be like anchorman. It's gonna be like qqq a sdf 123, you know type of thing I mean in fairness to biden he hasn't been napping as much as he needs to but It's hard to see They're getting done, you know I mean this administration just just it doesn't seem to get a lot done like and you know Whatever like the the Trump administration Leaving Trump aside.

There were a lot of people in the administration who were effective at getting things done. So This this administration seems just just to not have like the drive to just get you done that that That that's why it's it's that's my impression. Um, so Um, you know, we definitely need to fix immigration policy like we had covid which was an issue and and so that was like one reason to like not you know, I guess Climb down it on but now let's now we moved on and so let's let's just make sure we're getting top talent In the United States Um, and really I'd say broadly it's anyone who who wants to work the rest of And and and contribute more than they take to the economy like that's just nothing They take to the economy like that's just necessarily going to make for a stronger better society in america.

Ylan, did you see uh, jeff's Bezos's tweet back and forth with biden Where biden I think was talking about inflation inflation But then he correlated that to taxing corporations and Bezos said this is misinformation and disinformation etc Etc. What do you what do you think about that whole exchange then back and forth? I mean the the obvious reason for inflation is that the government printed a zillion amount of more money than it had obviously Um, so it's like the government can't just You know have Issue checks far in excess of revenue without there being inflation Um, you know velocity of money held constant So unless there's something would change with velocity of money, but but it's just the federal government rights checks They don't they never bounce so that is effectively creation of more of more dollars And if if there are more dollars created then the increase in the goods and services output of the economy Then you have inflation again velocity of money held constant.

Um, but so uh This is just this is very basic. This is not like uh, you know, uh, super complicated. Um And if the government could just issue Uh massive amounts of money and have and deficits didn't matter then well, why don't we just make the deficit a hundred times bigger? Okay, the answer is you can't because it will basically turn the dollar into something that is worthless. So Um, and and various countries have ever have tried this experiment multiple times It's not like oh, I wonder what happens if this if this is done Yeah, have you seen Venezuela like the the poor people of Venezuela are you know have been just run roughshod by their government? um, and So obviously you can't simply Create money the the the true economy is very important like the true economy is the output of goods and services It's not money It's it's literally what is the output of goods and services money is simply a way to For us to or anything that you call money Um is is a way for us to conveniently exchange goods and services without having to engage in barter and also to shift obligations in time that those are the two reasons that you have money This thing called money.

It's it's really it's a database The money is a is an information system for uh for labor allocation and for exchange of goods and services and for translating in time um And the quality of that information is a function of it's like you basically you can apply information theory to money and I think it it helps explain Why one money system is why one action is better than another and so like the money you you just just like a An internet connection you'd want something that's high bandwidth uh low latency and jitter and uh, it's not dropping packets does not have a lot of errors in the system Um, and the same is true true of money.

Um You want then and really like you said what what did PayPal really really do that? It helped improve the the the bandwidth the speed at which money could move Instead of of mailing checks back and forth, which amazingly that was what people did in 2000 You you could now do real time exchange of of money And and now you could ship your goods immediately instead of mailing a check and waiting for the bank to clear the check so Like and and the the ultimate thing with PayPal or if it sort of was in the x.com

Sort of went more less sort of niche payments more sort of broad financial would be to simply just that Just need to mediate all the heterogeneous cobalt databases out there running on mainframes during batch processing and have a single real time system that That was secure. Um and not batch processing. Um, and so It would just it would just be from an information standpoint more efficient and and eventually it would all the the Batch processing cobalt mainframes operated by the banks would cease to exist you've um spent more time uh and uh built more in china than Almost anybody.

I mean apple would be the only company I could think of that's probably got a bigger footprint But I'm not certain of that Um, what have you learned about china? that you didn't know before you opened the factories there and started delivering cobalt and opened the factories there and started delivering cars there And what should we know about china, you know as americans? How should we think about china and our relationship with it because we haven't spent time there? Sure. Well, I'd say like china first of all is not monolithic. It's not like uh, everything is not some plot by the chinese government.

Um, the There are many factions within china that compete vigorously within china. Um, and uh, so um and Perhaps most important is that there's just a Just a tremendous number of hardworking smart people in china who want to get ahead and get things done Um, and they're not complacent and they're not entitled Um, and they're gonna they're they want to get things done and they they want to make a better life for themselves um, and What we're gonna see uh with was china for uh for the first time that anyone can remember who is alive Is an economy that is twice the size of the us possibly three times the size of the us It's going to be very weird living in that world so We better Stop the in fighting in the us and stop punching ourselves in the face because like there's a whole there's way too much You know of america punching itself in the damn face.

It's just just dumb um and and think about like hey, we got to be competitive here and and uh, there's a new kid on the block That's gonna be two or three times our size We better step up our game um, and uh, you know and stop in fighting You think it's easier to stop in fighting once we're beaten or do you think that there's a way Folks here can actually just you know get their political and Commercial act together, but or does it not happen until we've realized we've lost or do we need a war? I mean, I sure hope we don't need we need a war um But there will be certainly um You know an economic competition that I think will will blow people away And when they realize just how competitive they have to be to be competitive with companies in china.

It's very difficult um, you know tesla is competitive her tessa is competitive because we have an awesome team in china that uh, you know, so um Like do your tesla china employees work some meaningful percentage more or harder than your tesla non china employees? Do you find like it's two different companies basically? well, I mean I think tesla is somewhat it tesla is sort of pretty far out there in terms of work ethic anywhere in the world so The tells of work ethic in the u.s. I think is substantially greater than than any other car company or or any large manufacturing company that i'm aware of um, so, you know tesla tesla does have a strong work work ethic in the u.s.

But but To be totally frank it the work that work ethic is exceeded um on balance by uh The tesla china team that that is I think objectively true So There's not say there aren't lots of hardworking people that tells the u.s. There certainly are um, but if you say on average the the the work ethic in china is higher. It's just Tell us tell us what you're calling it like it is, you know, so what about if you're an american ceo how do you deal with you think? just the need for managing all these political factions inside of a company you probably saw You know all the sturm and drong related to disney and what happened to them and what's continuing to happen to them on both sides Between their employees as well as the governments etc um You have any advice or what do you tell like young ceos that you hang out with about how to deal with that How to make those decisions where you land in the spectrum of dealing with all of this stuff The non work issues that are related to now, you know going to work every day I'm not sure I entirely understand what you mean like You know all the although that whether it's the the need for political correctness or the need for having Political points of view and having to bring that and balance that in the workplace.

How do you deal with that? How do you give advice to other folks about having to deal with it? Look, I think it you know the the point of a company is to produce useful products and services For your fellow human beings. It is not, uh, you know some political gathering place or Or a thing where it that's the point of the company like it's I'd say like it's you know politics and other stuff should It's not the side of why companies should exist So I I I I got it I got a I'm actually late for I'm gonna work on the rocket guys.

Uh, yeah Um, we're gonna go ahead and let you get to Mars and I'll see you soon Rain man David I'm going all in and it said we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it. I'm a queen of Kenwa Besties are gone Uh, this is my dog taking it on his new driveway We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow What you're about be what you're be Be what we need to get I'm doing all in
