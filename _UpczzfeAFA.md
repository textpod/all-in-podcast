I literally don't want to talk about brigading guys, though, only because it's getting crazy. And I had to like mod my stuff. So start the recording, please. Start the recording. I'm going to strike it by brigades. You mean like MAGA brigades? All right. Listen, it. No, I'm serious. You think because I can call them going to call them off? Hold on. Hold on. Hey, Donnie. Hey, Donnie. Jake, I'll say he's being brigaded by MAGA. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He can't handle it. He's tapping out. I tap out. I tap out. He can't fault the dogs. OK.

All right. It's all good. It's all good. They're talking about it. It's it's over. They're not going to they're not going to brigade anymore. The sign up is over. Thank you. Thank you. It's getting pretty. It's getting pretty. That's done. Don't worry about it. All right, everybody, welcome to episode 96 of the All In podcast. We had a bomb drop just yesterday with Adobe agreeing to acquire Figma, the design tool. We'll get into that in a minute. What it actually does for 20 billion dollars. This is just astounding for this to happen. Period. Full stop.

It's the largest private company purchase I believe in history. This company, if you don't know, it helps you design web apps or user interfaces. So if you're a designer, we used to make mockups. We'd send them around in the industry as images or PDFs. And then like Google Docs where you can put comments on somebody else's words and you can collaborate in real time, we call it multiplayer mode. Figma is multiplayer mode. The company is just a juggernaut. If you work in startups, you get Figma designs all day. And Adobe stock got crushed because of this.

It was down as much as 18% on Thursday. Figma's most recent valuation was 10 billion dollars in June of 2021. Their series E, so peak market, they had raised 200 million at that time. There's a lot of details to get into here, but listen, let's ask the Sultan of Sass here what you think of this because it's double what was an incredible market last year that was overheated. So what does this say about the market, Figma, Figma itself or maybe Adobe's jumping the fence or being skittish? How do we reconcile this, Sass? If you judge Adobe stock price the other day, the market hated the deal.

I mean, the Adobe stock price went down like 15% and that's a $150 billion company roughly. So they lost almost the entire purchase price in the market capitalization of Figma. I think that's basically an overreaction. I know all the news is basically on how Adobe is paying 50 times and that's no longer the multiple. The multiple is more like eight, nine, ten times for high gross Sass companies. There is truth to that but I think it misses some important details about how fast Figma is growing. Can we actually throw up on the screen the AR history of this company? And for people who know the multiple is the multiple times top line revenue.

Times ARR really. So explain that to folks. Well, ARR is just the annually recurring revenue, it's subscription revenue. Sometimes people will look at next 12 months revenue, which is a similar concept not quite the same, but sort of in the ballpark. So, you know, what's interesting about this company, I think it was founded 2011, 2012. It had a very long wilderness period. That's when I call the period where the founders are trying to figure out what the product is going to be. Really for almost five years, they finally launched a private beta in 2015. They then opened it up to public launch in 2016 and they didn't turn on monetization until 2017.

So, five years into the company that hadn't made a dime. So, you know, it's roughly a 10 year old company and for the first five years didn't make any money and then they started to make money five years ago. And then in 2018, I think they turned on the enterprise tier and then it's been kind of off to the races. That's incredible. Yeah, what I can tell you looking at these numbers, by the way, so I don't know if these numbers are perfectly correct. This is sort of, I would call this Scuttlebutt numbers. These are numbers that I believe to be true.

But it's not like these are numbers that the company's confirmed or anything like that. This is just me gathering, you know, intelligence from talking to people in Silicon Valley. So, this is where I believe to be the case. Can you read the numbers for people that watch on YouTube watching this? Yeah. So, in 2017, again, the first year they monetized, they did 700,000. They ended the year with 700,000 of ARR. Remember that ARR is kind of a point in time metric. It's the amount of subscription revenue, your annual run rate, subscription revenue at that time.

So, they ended 2017 with 700,000. 2018, they ended with 4 million. 2019, they ended with 23 million. 2020, they ended with 77 million. 2021, 210 million. And then the estimated number for this year is 450. So, you've seen in the press, I think it has been publicly reported, a $400 million ARR numbers currently where they're at. I've heard that they're going to end with something more like 450 this year and then their forecast for next year is or was at some point in time when somebody heard this. 800 million forecast for 2023. So, my point is I've seen a lot of SAS metrics and I can tell you that this ARR ramp is phenomenal.

You know, I'm sure people have kind of heard about the triple, triple, double, double. That's kind of what VCs want you to do. They want you to triple two years in a row then they want you to double two years in a row and so forth. This company did way better than that. I mean, 700K to 4 million is a really fast ramp. And then 4 million to 23 million is incredible. That's like, you know, over a 5X and then they did over a 3X going from 23 to 77 million. I can tell you that is super hard.

I think most companies, even the ones that hit low 20s tripling year over year, they tend to decelerate to two and a half times or something like that. This company was still growing over 3X then they roughly tripled again to get to 210 and then since they have a question. Yeah. So now they're double that. Do you think the triple in 2020 was a COVID pull forward? Yeah. Or do you think that that was a natural, like a zoom or not? I mean, it's possible but because people were collaborating. No, I don't see. I mean, so far in the numbers, I don't see a huge slowdown here.

I mean, look, once the numbers get into hundreds of millions, it's really hard to maintain the same growth rate. You're compounding off such a large base that it's just inevitable. You can't keep growing 3X year over year once you're at 200 million of ARR. But the fact they got first from 23 to 77 and then 77 to 210 and now 210, let's say they're at 400 now and they're going to be at 450 by the end of the year plus. It's pretty amazing and so, okay, so yeah, so Adobe is paying 50 times current ARR.

But if you believe this, they're only paying divide by 2. They're paying 25 times end of next year. So like 18 months from now and then you figure, you know, within say two years after that they're going to be, you know, at somewhere between 1.5 and 2 billion of ARR. And as you guys know, there just aren't that many SaaS companies that even get to a billion of ARR. So I don't think Adobe is making a bad deal here. I think there's a question about is there any point at which this product hits some sort of market saturation but Adobe is in a good position to know that because they understand this market.

They are in this market. It feels to me like I don't know, I've been using Adobe Photoshop right around when it first came out like 1992 and this product I've used it, it was built web first. It was built for collaborative years and Photoshop over the years they've really tried to take what is a desktop installed software application and then try and create cloud based features and it's a terrible, terrible user experience at least from my perspective having grown up on using Adobe Photoshop. But what's most important I think is a lot of people think about this on is it the right price to pay for the company but at the end of the day the right price to pay for the company is what Adobe views to be the risk and reward for their business and they effectively paid roughly 12% of their company to do this deal.

So they're saying let's take 12% of our company and effectively de risk the biggest risk to our business. Take out the biggest threat to our business for 12% of our company. Not 12% Was it 12%? You have to factor in the actual drawdown of the stock as well so it's about 33% they effectively Well I'm talking about like take the price of the stock aside the number of shares they're issuing because by the way the deal value went down with the stock. So I read the merger terms last night and there's a couple billion of cash and then a good chunk of it is in stock and it's a 10 billion of cash and it's 10 billion of shares at the price when the deal was announced into your point.

So it's a fixed number of shares. It's a fixed number of shares it's not a fixed monetary value. So it's down 20% from the deal announcement. So that 10 billion of stock is now actually 8 billion of stocks. So no the whole deal is now 18 billion not. Was it 10 billion of cash Chimoth? Did 10 billion cash? There's 2 billion of deferred RSUs in stock based compensation. But I mean if you think about it at the time of the merger they're either I think they have they're going to use some term loan that they have to get the cash but they're effectively issuing you know 10 divided by their total share count which is roughly 6% of their total shares outstanding.

So you know they're kind of taking 6% or let's just aggregate the two together and say they're taking roughly 12% delusion share the value of the stock goes down. So look I think like this deal is really interesting. So first let's just give huge kudos to the CEO and the team and the investors. What an enormous win for all those folks. That's awesome. It keeps Silicon Valley kind of going right and that's just awesome to see these kind of big wins. I read this incredible profile about the founder and he sounded like such a fascinating person he basically the profile basically said that he was spending months and months going from office to office all around the world meeting customers sitting with customers reading trouble tickets that's what he would do you know reading help desk tickets about the product on vacation whenever you see a CEO that is so customer obsessed typically there's good outcomes and so this is just another validating point on that theme now let's just put Figma aside and let's just talk about Adobe for a second.

What is so incredible is you have a company yes they spent 20 billion dollars or whatever 18 billion now but the way that they did it is really interesting if you go back to Zen Desk and Survey Monkey when those guys announced that merger it was above the threshold of stock where you have to go to a shareholder vote and because there was so much turbulence in the market whether the industrial logic of that deal made sense or not didn't matter as much to shareholders when it came time to vote and they voted it down right so interestingly Adobe was very clever they said I'm going to do half cash half stock so that I'm below the threshold we are below the threshold where it goes to a shareholder vote okay interesting but then you have to factor in the dilution not just the dilution of the stock but then the rewriting of the stock and this is where you lose 20% of your market cap and then you tack on this you're talking about a 30, 40 billion dollar price tag to get the deal done and I think that's where the head scratcher was in the public markets where folks basically rebuilt their model and said hold on a second you know you've been telling me that this problem is a solved problem but when you pay such a premium not only does it mean that this product is clearly materially growing and disrupting but the existing revenue base that I was counting on in my model must be wrong as well and that's the actual flywheel that now Adobe is in where people are trying to really figure out how under pressure are those existing cash flows and then if you compound that with something else which is nothing specific to Adobe but to the whole market which is now interest rates are going up behind the scenes you have this sort of parade of terribles for Adobe that they're going to have to navigate right they have a very large portion of cash they have a large portion of stock they have decaying earnings in their core business that they now have to explain and then they don't really have a lot of earnings I think Shantanu said that it's going to be year 3 before it's accretive which is typically a way of saying we're going to lose money and then in year 3 we'll make at least a penny that's what accretive means doesn't mean you're going to make billions necessarily and so these guys have to find a way for Figma to drop about a billion and a half dollars of free cash flow into the business for this to kind of make sense in the short term so I think those are all the mechanics that's sort of putting a lot of pressure on the Adobe stock but it just goes to show you the amount of disruption that happens this movement to the cloud or the movement to collaboration monolithic products are just sort of very much DLA that is the key I think you guys did a great job of summarizing it this is an absolutely great deal for Adobe it's a transformative deal in the same way the WhatsApp deal was for Facebook it removes one of the two existential threats to Adobe and it turns Adobe I guess into a growth story now as pointed out Adobe's product was single player mode and Adobe grows at about 12 or 13 percent right now and now you have a company that doubles and they really have been facing three paradigm shifts in the last five or so years obviously you pointed out one Freedberg desktop software downloading it versus cloud based software well here they go now they've got experts in cloud and then the second one but they have a thing called creative cloud and they are slowly trying to figure that it's a paradigm shift inside the company they've really struggled so now they have somebody who's cloud first Tramoth do you guys ever use those products? hold on let me finish here these three paradigm shifts here feature for feature they look very similar no so these three paradigm shifts the one is the desktop versus the web the other one is subscription so Adobe was charging a thousand dollars a year for the creative cloud now they charge 25 bucks a month for it they successfully did that now they've successfully figured out collaboration software but Adobe has one thing that they have not done which I think is the real reason they had to buy Figma Adobe see this is the problem with these big public companies Adobe and all of their investors got very addicted to the free cash flow generation of that stock and it's been an incredible performer and let's just be honest Shantanu is one of the best CEOs of the last few decades in the public markets period end of story okay since 2007 he has just run a masterful playbook at the tail end of that though you know in 2022 this is a company that has I think six or seven maybe I think maybe eight billion dollars of free cash flow it is a gargantuan money making business and so they refused in creative cloud to go to that free tier that Figma has and if you look at all of the stories around Figma one of the most powerful things they did was basically allow people to use this for free effectively effectively forever yeah bottom ups ass and the problem with Adobe is like that's a business model disruption that they could not afford in the public markets because if you condition a set of institutional investors to be expecting seven to eight billion dollars of annual free cash flow and all of a sudden you're willing to torch it to take a quarter of that and make it free that is probably the biggest reason why they had to buy this thing which was that they needed to tuck it in and they're like how can I do it well I just have to do it by diluting the stock one time stock insurance yeah that was it it was a one 12% diluted still and then it's one and done it's one more to go the point the point you guys are making is more broad which is it's not just about Adobe this is the classic innovators dilemma right like any big company that reaches maturity in their market and has scale and has cash flows you have a different shareholder base you move over from growth to value and once you've got value shareholders I mean I've been to these institutional meetings when I was on the exact team at Monsanto and you know they wanted dividends and they wanted stock buybacks and they they're like it's nice to see growth but at the end of the day I want to know where's my dividend going to be and what's my stock buyback target going to be and then to say hey I got to go invest in innovating my way out of my corner because you know in this case cloud is reinventing my marketplace it is a very hard place for a manager of a business of that scale to be by the way I think there's a quarter every industry by the way I think there's another take away that's really interesting here which is that if you look at big tech companies I think you almost have to sort them into two buckets at least in the enterprise and sat that sucks you can tell me if you disagree but there's one type of enterprise company which makes basically a single linear monolithic product or a handful of those monolithic products right think work day think adobe etc but then there's this other type of company which are more platform level businesses that have this you know mixture of things that they do relatively well integrated maybe each product is not so great but together they're pretty decent and you have distribution leverage and you have pricing power think microsoft and the totality of those products so what's interesting to me is you cannot effectively compete as it turns out against microsoft at any point product and Slack I think is the best example where microsoft teams was fundamentally cannibalizing this business which is what drove Slack into the arms of sales force and you know you could say that teams was not as great of a product I would make that claim but what microsoft had was distribution scale and pricing power where you could discount and effectively give it away for free adobe isn't in that situation right they can't do that kind of stuff and so when you compete against those kinds of businesses you have a better chance of winning the takeaway I think for the entrepreneur is when you're thinking about the next enterprise business to start I would try to bucket these companies that you want to compete with and say if I'm going to build a newer version of X make sure that version of X is going after a company like adobe versus a company like microsoft because it's much much much easier to build value when you're competing against a monolithic product company versus an entangled platform company.

Saks would you bundle if you were the CEO of Figma would you now, I'm sorry CEO of adobe would you bundle Figma into the creative cloud and then just make it one subscription would you microsoft teams that yeah maybe I don't know I'm not sure about that I do think that microsoft is a little bit unique in its ability to bundle so what my so Tramath is right about the power of the bundling what they do is I think it's called the E5 bundle they have all these products that virtually all enterprises use from office to active directory to you know there's like a whole long list of them and so what they've done is they've created one price for all of those products that they sell as a bundle under a wall to wall enterprise license and what they do is when they see a new competitor come along whether it's slack or zoom or or octa is they'll basically just clone it create a worse version of that product and throw it into the bundle and so now every single enterprise is getting the slack clone or the zoom clone or whatever for free and that has a huge material impact on you know it pulls the rug out from under those startups so now that's not to say that microsoft product is anywhere near as good as those competitors but you know now all of a sudden the microsoft product is on a marginal basis free but then what microsoft does is you know every year or two they go raise the price of the bundle so basically they get you hooked on the bundle they then use it to systematically kill or undermine a competitor and then they know you're stuck and then they raise the price they basically have inflation of the price of the whole bundle I think it's very anti competitive actually I think it's it's akin to dumping I'm not sure what the logical stopping point of it is like I don't know if we can have a healthy SaaS market if microsoft is allowed to keep doing this forever because think about it I mean they will just every year they will take the hot SaaS company du jour clone it it'll be a shitty version they'll throw it into their bundle and now they're dumping they're dumping the product in the market it's basically free it's free until they basically drive they drive out the competitor or destroy it or basically undermine its market cap to the point where it can no longer make the kinds of investments it needs to pose a real threat to the microsoft larger entity right so think about how any competitive this is and you don't hear a word about this from Lena Kahn or Washington they're only focused on social networks no it's so funny it's like she's more focused on you know making sure Amazon doesn't buy Roomba that you know this stuff that's happening or facebook doesn't buy one VR app it's not very sophisticated approach this is the kind of stuff that actually really matters I really think you nailed it on the head sacks it's an impossible strategy to defend against the other thing that is interesting by the way about all of this is you know if you think that the valuation the takeout premium was basically 2x post to post what that means is that if Figma was last value to 10 is now worth 20 does that mean that Canva which was last priced at 40 is worth 80 well potentially to adobe right and if you add those two together now what you really have is basically the entire totality of the creative cloud for adobe is basically embedded now in these two businesses at an extreme premium and so it makes it very difficult now I think as well for adobe to execute a strategy here without it being forced to do some more expensive deluded M&A and the other problem is this is going to ring bell so when I said before there were two existential threats Canva is the other one that is the other paradigm shift that's occurred in computing is that making things radically simple you talked about a freeberg photoshop is complex and it's single player canva is how people create any kind of marketing materials today and they don't hire a designer anymore the job of graphic designer is now everybody's job everybody can make something on canva but then I think sacks or freeberg maybe you have thoughts on this if you're Alina Khan and they do make a run at canva adobe now are you saying like hey wait a second you now run the table on all design tools you can't buy it it's a weird classification it's only called design tools because it was sold to someone that was called a designer before and that's not the case anymore now it's a tool that anyone can use in the enterprise setting or in a small small business setting or in an individual setting to create stuff and that wasn't the case with photoshop and I think that's what makes this arguably a very different business a bigger business a more transformative business and a farther reaching business and I don't think that there's necessarily a speaking of the figma deal right a case to be made here that they're preventing the extinction of their monopoly they're buying what looks like a very different business and it's really additive it's a business that can turn anyone into a creator it's really cool yeah but you're kind of speaking out of both sides of your mouth now because on the one hand you're saying it's a different business but on the other hand you said that this is basically protecting them against an existential disruption to their core business so if it's an existential disruption to their core business how could it not be in the same market of course it's in the same market well there are new entrants competitors and there are different underlying you know technology trends this is all about cloud but nonetheless I don't see how these things aren't competitors with each other to some degree so I don't know how this doesn't get seriously reviewed yeah I antitrust authorities it feels so similar to Facebook Instagram and Google YouTube and by the way it's similar in both those examples in a number of ways both Facebook Instagram was not competing in the same product as Facebook at the time with the newsfeed or whatever it was a photo sharing service that clearly created a broader addressable market that got more people to use a social network and YouTube people thought they were overpaying right and then YouTube everyone thought it was crazy they paid a billion six for that business and it's probably the greatest acquisition of all time it's been the greatest managed acquisition of all time I should say and that business similarly I think Google recognized that people were going to move to video content as an alternative to text based web content and that it was a bigger picture opportunity than what they were pursuing and in the lane that they operated in at that time and they were right and in both cases it was more about paying whatever it took to get the deal done then you know hey how many users do you have how much revenue how much EBITDA what's your ARR all that stuff goes out the window when you're sitting in that strategic driver seat at that big company and you're saying this is a bigger market these guys are transforming the market and ultimately over time that will eclipse us and you can say hey you're protecting your business but really you're protecting your market I mean the market is going to go away is what the vision is like the market that you exist in today isn't going to exist in the same way in five ten years and that's what you're trying to buy your way into I have a question and a statement the statement is I think Canva should absolutely go public versus sell because it seems like they'll have a much easier time competing against whomever that they compete with I do think that David you're right that there is a lot here for regulatory review because if you go back and think about Visa plaid you know it's not dissimilar meaning you have a young startup that has this really credible and viable technology potentially being acquired by in that case it was one of a duopoly but here you could make a very credible claim that it's in a market where it's roughly a monopoly because there aren't really that many meaningful alternative so I think Sax is right that there's that there's some there's a case here there's a case here where it just depends on the size of the product that was literally my question well not just Roomba how about that VR game that Facebook that was a tiny acquisition that maybe had a million users they're just being punitive they are being punitive it seems like what the antitrust authorities are doing right now in Washington is they've got a list of companies that they think are putatively suspect is to stop these companies from accumulating more power and it's really about seeing everything through this lens of power but that's not what the competition authorities are supposed to do they're supposed to ensure competition it's about antitrust it should be a rule buck right and the problem with just approaching things in this way of the punitive way we just have to stop these companies is it creates a chilling effect on reasonable exits in Silicon Valley there aren't that many great exits and we want them to go through now I think if monopolies need to be reined in there are other tools to use besides just saying that those companies can't acquire other companies no matter how unobjectionable they are I mean let's do things like allow side loading let's basically what explain what that is well that's basically a way to say that I think Google the Android already does it but iOS does not where you would be able to basically install an app or download an app without going through the Apple App Store you could enable competitive app stores basically I think it's a real issue that you have operating system monopolies I mean Google Android and iOS with Apple and then Amazon with sort of white label products those are all operating systems that are competing with apps on their own platform and there have to be some constraints and rules around that otherwise the operating system will eventually dominate and replace any app they want to on the platform we saw that's what the whole Microsoft thing was about Microsoft Netscape was 100% about that so I think if you can show that somebody has an operating system monopoly there absolutely should be rules of constraints around that does it mean the company should never be able to buy anything no I mean I think all that does is stifle innovation without really getting to the crux of what the issue is I think you nailed it a good first step would be allow other app stores so Google's app store could be on iOS iOS's app store could be on another platform etc and the other issue here is Lena Kahn's been pretty clear her entire thesis in taking the job was well I want to prevent downstream competitive issues so future competition there's no better example of a future competitive issue and future consumer harm I think it's how she phrases it then this acquisition if you're going to do it through the lens of future consumer harm this creates future consumer consumer harm because Figma you're saying you're not going to compete with Adobe you're saying that it does it does massively I mean it this is the the dissonance here it is great for consumers because they will bundle it they'll bundle the two things together and it'll make it more valuable and reduce churn and it'll make it simple to buy so that's good for consumers right you get more free stuff but future harm and a future competitive harm here is the marketplace will be less competitive if there's one less independent strong company in it that's and if you if they buy Canva that's the definition of downstream downstream competitive harm it'll be a less competitive marketplace with these two companies together full stop so Jacob do you if you're Lena Khan you actually pay attention to this Adobe Figma thing in like a serious way or are you still more focused on Amazon and you know Facebook and I would hope that they would do multiple things saying what would you do if I was her I would create a rulebook and apply the rulebook evenly and fairly and this is the problem this feels very political it feels like they're going after Facebook because of the downstream political issues Facebook causes and they're ignoring the Microsoft issue and they're ignoring issues like this you know it just feels like they have their thumb on the scale if you look at what happened to the visa plat thing it was an enormous blessing in disguise because you know the the thing went away and that was I think like a five billion dollar acquisition and then plat turned around and raised money and it's like a you know multiple teens billion it's going to be a wonderful independent company to your point Jason that will now you know create more competition in a space that desperately needed now in that case that was sort of like financial payments and rails and visa mastercard blah blah blah but that that could also be you know if there is a lot of attention paid to the deal and it doesn't end up being consummated that could be the positive outcome but if you wanted future competition if you asked me if I was betting man I think this thing is going to close I think it closes yeah yeah I mean it closes it closes because it doesn't intrude on the hot buttons of Washington not because the merits of the antitrust are superior to the Roomba deal or to that VR deal that Facebook wants to have this is all about political and cultural hot buttons so it's so weird yeah but I think we all understand what's really going on it's all political but hey Jase can I go back to your question I think it was a really good question I've had more chance to think about should Adobe change the pricing of Figma should they basically bundle it I was talking about the merits of what Microsoft does I don't think that Figma should do that here now they've had a chance to think about it the reason is this that you have to think of pricing as not an element by itself but as sort of the most important element of a go to market strategy and there's no way that you can basically price Figma completely as part of some other bundle and expect not to create massive disruption to your go to market organization so for example you've got now a whole huge sales team at Figma including enterprise sales they are commissioned based on their the quotas that they close and that's based on the ACV of the deals and so on if all of a sudden you price this as being free because it's part of some bundle that enterprises get because they're buying old Adobe now all of a sudden those sales people can't earn commission on that sale they can't be incentivized to take that product to market the same way the marketing team is tasked with feeding the sales team so now all of a sudden they're like wait a second can we spend money to basically promote this product when it's going to lead to a deal that's priced at zero because the enterprise already has an ELA with Adobe so you can't just look at a pricing change in isolation you have to look at it as the tip of the spear of the whole go to market I can tell you what's going to happen because I kind of experiences with Yammer when Microsoft bought my company 10 years ago and by the way I'm not critical of Microsoft at all they were an extremely high quality acquire that lived up to all their promises and did everything they said they were going to do I think if you ever get an offer from Microsoft you should take it really seriously I think like I said I think they're a great company great acquire but I can tell you what happened is that once Yammer was folded in to the office suite and didn't have its own independent sales team it just disappeared I mean the promotion of it to stop because nobody had an incentive to basically go sell it nobody had an incentive to go market and promote it and it's kind of disappeared and that is why you remember a couple of years after we sold it Slack kind of came out of nowhere and there was no one to really oppose them because you know all the promotional activity we had done around Yammer just ended because again we weren't we didn't have the incentive that was created by the sales organization.

Just to explain the pricing thing David I think that the way this decision will get made and I'm not saying it's right or wrong but it will get made not by the sales teams and not by the product teams but it will get made by the CEO and the CFO in talking to their largest shareholders and the reason is because there is an implied cost of capital that Adobe has in fact right now if you look at like all of the models that all of the analysts use is roughly around 9% and so they're going to have to achieve a return on top of that cost of capital what that means is that they're going to be forced to find a way in short order to make this accretive and to start generating incremental cash flow and I think that they will be hard pressed not to bundle and not to do these creative packaging strategies because otherwise I think that there is a risk that this free cash flow machine that folks have become very addicted to at Adobe starts to shrink and that will have huge ramifications I think to the stock and to the executives and to the morale and so I think that they're going to do whatever it takes and by the way you've seen that in other companies who've gone into this phase of their growth Oracle being the best example you know they have consistently found ways to package to bundle to cross sell to upsell and they have incrementally walked free cash flow generation up if they do that they're taking a huge risk because here's what's going to happen is so I agree with you about what may happen this may be decided by the CEO and the board but I think if they do this they could blow it I mean the you know Dillon Field the founder in his blog post on this said that Adobe's committed to letting them run independently well you can't run independently if you don't have your own independent pricing you just can't for how long is the question if all of a sudden if all of a sudden Adobe salespeople can sell this product and include it in their bundle and the marginal price is basically free because it's part of some bundle that means the sale has been taken away from whoever the dedicated salespeople are on the figma side of the house I can tell you that will create irrationality in the sales organization and very soon there'll be pressure to consolidate the Figma sales organization with the larger Adobe sales organization they'll be moved in they may become product specialists or experts but the go to market efforts will be consolidated and then Dillon's going to end up running a quote standalone version of Figma that doesn't have its own go to market organization and then you don't get the feedback into product from your sales and marketing team so all of a sudden you're running a product and engineering team but you don't have eyes and ears in the market.

I hear all of that I think that the Facebook WhatsApp mergers probably pretty instructive which is Jan had two years roughly where he was left alone to kind of like run independently and then slowly and slowly it is absorbed back into the mothership and you know that was a product with zero monetization but there was a lot of strategic touch points within WhatsApp and you know core Facebook app and everything else that they were doing and I think that you have to do that because you're spending tens of billions of dollars on something. There needs to be an industrial logic that is beyond just let me just buy this thing and stick it on the shelf and let it be on its own.

So I think that you know that die is sort of cast I think we're just debating the timeline in which it happens. Let's talk about you're probably right and that's what usually happens is when they promise the founder that you'll be left alone that usually last two years that coincidentally usually the length of the the earn out or the golden handcuffs that's how long my golden handcuffs were and they left us alone for one year by the way our ARR tripled that year but then once they got serious about integration the organization started merging and really I was just running a product organization which is fine but that's not running an independent company because like I said you lose your eyes and ears you lose the pulse of the market when you're not selling into the market Freeberg how did YouTube do it so well? YouTube was a very different situation they were Google basically took a team of you know two dozen people and their infrastructure was terrible and they basically rebuilt the entire company so it was the complete opposite think about them taking the front end shell of YouTube and then they rebuilt everything underneath it ran it and then they actually put their own people in to optimize the front end they put their own ad sales team on top of it I mean they just bought a skeleton of a growth engine and they built everything and so it was a very different story and the one thing that YouTube the one thing that Google did so well with that acquisition was the conviction bet that they made on the business and they made billions and billions of dollars of investments into that business for years before it started to make money and that is a very hard thing to do because to Chamath's point you often have this question of where your free cash flow is where is your dividends, where is your buybacks as a business gets to a certain point of maturity but what Google had that many businesses of that scale have never had before is their extraordinary growth rate that continued even as they were of that scale so the the leeway that Google's executives and board were given by shareholders was extraordinary and they mentioned the dual voting where Larry and Sergey could decide to do whatever the heck they wanted but they really were able to take advantage of their high growth rate to take all this cash they were generating and reinvest it into this YouTube platform as well as many other things many of which haven't worked out but when they do work out you have a business that I think YouTube is probably worth what 300, 400, 500 billion dollars at this point and and it's really paid back multiple so YouTube is really a one off one off acquirer and it was a one off kind of acquisition integration scenario that we haven't seen before what Google in effect got when they acquired YouTube was a flywheel I mean it was a brand and it was a network effect and the network effect was massive it was off to the races and I remember Google had Google videos but they just couldn't come close to catching YouTube because the flywheel of creators wanting to be where all the viewers were and viewers wanting to be where the most content was it was just impossible to catch and that organization was relatively tiny at the time it was acquired and it didn't have any monetization and it was being deluged it was being deluged by legal problems that Google legal could solve Very unique situation yeah that was one of the bold acquisitions of all time but what was incredible is right after the acquisition and Google started to scale this thing most of the content being watched on YouTube was copyright content and I was at a conference and I remember Philippe Daman the CEO Viacom stood up and he was on stage and Eric or Larry and Sergey someone was on stage and he yelled at them and he was like you guys are making all this money and growing this YouTube business off of the back of our content and you know the DMCA the Digital Millennium Copyright Act says that someone can file a takedown notice and then the platform has a period of time to respond and to deal with it and the amount of time it was taking them to deal with it new content was being uploaded and then they'd have to file another takedown notice so it created this insurmountable copyright thing and then what did Google do that YouTube would have never been able to do to Saks's point they built an engine that could automatically recognize copyright content and pull it down before it was made publicly available with that ruining the user experience of instant upload and availability of content for other content.

The fingerprint system was even more nuanced than that the fingerprint system not only told him hey this is an SNL skit or this is a music video from Prince it said what would you like to do and it put the power in their hands and said turn it off, claim it and we get the money from it and then it was like well we're telling you before you even know about it and what all these people did was they say okay yeah you can make a remix of my Prince song or this episode of a TV show we'll collect the money and that was just the revenue share was the brilliant part about it because it put the power in the copyright holders names this just speaks to how singularly how singular and unique that deal was because I don't think any other company at that time maybe Microsoft would have been able to develop technology to do this and do it at the scale and do it with this low latency and high speed for users and so on it really was a singular transaction.

Which Freberg I think speaks to their accumulation of talent especially in those early years where they were just like higher smart people will figure out what to do with them later they actually had those people sitting around who could just go jump on the YouTube team Oh my God, Solar Kamangar went and ran YouTube and absolutely crushed it probably one of the best ARR runs that's never talked about in the history of tech he stepped in and he ran YouTube and now Susan runs it another incredible run of monetizing that thing since but I mean and these are people by the way both Solar and Susan were sub 30 employee people at Google so yeah good point Nick can we throw up the slides contrasting valuation to ARR this is actually more interesting than just who made all the money so I actually created a plot ARR is the red chart and it's the right axis so as we talked about there are around 450 million of ARR right now and then the left axis is expected value basically this was their valuation and it's in purple and it obviously it goes up to the 20 billion or 22 billion that Adobe just paid you can see E was the last round they did in 2021 where they were valued at 10 billion before that they were valued at 2 billion in 2020 and then you know the series C I think they're valued at like 440 million or something like that and then I think the B they're valued at like 125 million and then the A they're valued at like 50 ish million you know and then there were a seed and so forth I think what you see here is that is how efficient in a way venture capital is where it's tracking just slightly ahead of ARR it is predicting where the hockey stick so first of all look at ARR it is as close to a pure hockey stick as I've ever seen in SAAS kudos to them I mean the crazy thing is just how long it took for the hockey stick to get going normally why didn't you invest in this company did you see it well no we didn't see it also look at what a late bloomer this thing is you know like that's incredible right you have to kind of see it like look like hockey stick didn't really start inflecting until 2018 2019 right so your table is more striking where these guys for years were toiling away and then all of a sudden this thing just took off right it's really incredible this was such a late bloomer and for anyone who's doing a SAAS company and you're in it five years and you still have zero revenue like that doesn't mean you're dead I mean they basically were a zero for five years finding exactly absolutely nothing and that was a $20 grand exit five years later I think the only hard round to invest in this company would have been if you were going to invest in I think the 2014 time period 2015 because you were investing in a company that hadn't even launched yet that had been grinding for three or four years with by the way the founder was like 19 when he started this he was a teal fellow he was one of the first you know 20 under 20 teal fellows yeah yeah and he dropped out of school to do this and you know and they spent several years in the wilderness I think that's when it would have been hard to invest is maybe not the first seed round because you could tell this guy was brilliant he had a really specific idea moving design tools to the cloud was I think like a very clear and sensible vision clear you know why now underlying trend I always say my three biggest traits for entrepreneurial success one of them is grit I mean you know if you have a high index on grit you're able to grind your way there it's really that's a really incredible this chart is brilliant because you know what we see in the seed stages right before that series a is where most people give up sacks you know you get three or four years in people aren't paying for the products you're under resource and they don't get the a and they got a you know that 2013 1415 period they were probably trying to get an a but it's a two years to get the a and then somebody finally decided easy for a young person to give up and go get a friggin job at Google or go back to school and to grind it out to have the grit and the persistence and commit to your vision he didn't pivot away he persisted and he executed clarified he clarified right yeah but he didn't he didn't go five steps away and say I'm going to do a new startup and you know there was no business right there's no private area Dylan field by the way as the founder I had him on the pod back in the day and really the ultimate customer focus customer like you said that wins you need to just have your pulse on what your customers are saying constantly because the answer is there you just have to develop it and give it to them by the way also in this chart that's I think very interesting sacks I'm interested in your position on this if you look at the chart one more time they could have turned on monetization I think a year or two before they did so they purposely didn't charge for it to get the network effects going I would love to see in here the number of users as a third vector you know as a third line on here because I think they started getting a lot of users in 2014 2015 2016 that's when that's why they got the seed but they purposely did not charge to let the network or for yeah 2015 was a private beta I don't think they were even had a product in 2014 that was usable yet 2015 was private beta 2016 was public launch and then they turned on monetization in 2017 and then they turn on enterprise pricing in 2018 so I think that's a pretty sound progression I I'm not I mean to be honest I'm not a big fan of taking three or four years in the wilderness to build your product I think you need to get to market sooner but I do think it is a little different in an existing industry where the table stakes are high so you know Adobe is not a cloud based product but those were very rich client products and so to get to the point where you could even compete with them with the classic Clay Christensen Innovators Dilemma lightweight version of the product that there were significant table stakes there and it was a significant technical challenge to move design tools into the browser they had to do a lot of cutting edge browser tech the browser wasn't ready for it this chart is going to be calling in a few years now that I'm doing after all in 48 hours after I think that's correct come join me with any questions SPACs are back I don't know if you saw in the news but FreeBurg launched a SPAC No no no he announced a target and a merger agreement so now he goes into the DSPAC process now we have two out of four besties have SPACed FreeBurg you want to tell us about SPAC? Well I mean we announced that we're merging the production board SPAC which is a TPB acquisition with Lavoro which is the largest agricultural inputs retailer in Brazil and operates across Latin America you know we've got a good slide in the presentation that I think echoes some of the points I've talked about on our podcast here about the importance of having resiliency and redundancy in global food supply chains and increasing famine risk so we've got a slide that shows for about 30 years you know we've reduced the number of people globally that have been undernourished down to about 600 million as of about three or four years ago and in the last three years we've seen that number spike back up to 800 million which we thought we were done with global famine and now here we are facing these issues again climate change the lockdown supply chain disruption the Ukraine war and all the other geopolitical tension issues so that's been a big thesis of mine individually you guys know we've talked offline about some investments I've made and my strong interest in the area Brazil and Latin America is the largest ag export market in the world so they produce calories for the rest of the world and farmers there largely lag in terms of technology adoption I've got a nice Brazilian farm as my background today but technology adoption doesn't look like it does in the US there's a huge opportunity to influence and drive productivity up in that region and so we partnered with the largest ag retailer ag retailer is the local locations that work with farmers they have these teams called agronomists they meet with the farmers typically weekly help them make decisions about what products to use what to do how to do it and so with the footprint and the reach that they have I think we can really drive up productivity per acre across the region increase total global calorie production and that's why I'm so excited about it fundamentally it's also a great business all the financials are presented in the investor presentation and will be published with the SEC here in the next couple days but it's a scaled business it's a profitable business and it's growing pretty significantly so it's got great tailwinds it's a great base business but for me there's huge opportunity to continue to drive their drive technology through the platform that they've built and that's why we're also making a hundred million dollar investment off our balance sheet into the company so that's big skin in the game big skin in the game and we put two thirds of our these founder promote shares they're the only vest if we can hit the stock price of $1250 and $15 over the next three years otherwise we lose them so we've really tried to align ourselves as shareholders and really put our money where our mouth is on this and show people that this is a real strategic partnership for us it's not just an investment that we intend to hold for a short period of time this is a key platform for me for our TPB business and for many of the companies that we operate at TPB so I'm super excited it's been a long time coming it's been a very hard process as Chamath can attest and as we all talk about capital markets are very difficult right now getting a transaction announced is the first step now there's a bigger step of getting a closed but yeah a lot of work but I'm super excited about this.

Thanks for letting me talk about it. Well and the other thing I just want to double click on there. Chamath this idea that two thirds of the sponsor promote have to hit certain hurdles I think that's probably a pretty good thing for folks who maybe want to invest to just say hey yeah this is great there's some alignment in how these shares get distributed yes. I mean I think it's a good feature I think that the thing with SPACS in general in a moment like this is that it actually performs better in periods of high volatility and the reason is because you know you have this redemption feature which essentially allows you to get back your basis and so meanwhile while you know that the tradeberg was hunting for a deal or whatever that cash that you've contributed into this SPACS sits in a savings account that then actually is generating some reasonable interest as rates go up so the whole combination of all of this stuff actually makes SPACS a pretty good risk adjusted vehicle when the markets are highly volatile because if at any point you don't like how you feel even if you love the deal you just vote to redeem get your $10 back and effectively when the market let's say the market goes down 30% from here to March of next year when freeberg's deal closes well an investor could theoretically just say you know what I just want my $10 back now all of a sudden they've gotten zero they felt zero percentage of that drawdown and that's what's so interesting about this structure in a moment like this so I think there's a lot of really interesting features that SPACS in the future I think will have to incorporate in order to be a successful tool in the toolbox.

One thing I learned from I guess the pattern AG company that I think you incubated as well or was that a couple yeah you incubated as well yeah and you guys invested through the through your launch platform so we invested this syndicate is that the way this retail works is we have farmers but then there are these retailers or these sales reps I guess they call them in the industry that service the farmers and so that's what this the farmers don't have this technology that's right they don't know how else is a farmer supposed to know what to buy and what to do so AG retail the local retail store the people that work there are called agronomists and so the agronomists are like technical sales people they understand the science and the technology of farming they understand what the farmers have done in the past and then they partner with them to help them decide what to do going forward what products to buy how to use them how to get the most out of their land and so when new technology when new AG technology comes to market it's the retailer that can influence the farmer to make a decision on making a switch or using a new tool or using some software to drive that decision and so that's why AG retail is so important and why it's critical for any new technology to get adopting it in farming it has to go through retail there's the big AG input companies there are the seed companies and the chemistry companies and the protection companies and the software companies they all don't sell direct to farmers typically they're going through these retailers and so yeah Is there a version of Lavoro that's an American company that's public or not? Yeah it's called Nutrient and so Nutrient owns CPS which is the largest retail chain in the US ag retail chain in the US about I think 70, 80% of Nutrients business is actually fertilizer production and then the rest is the retail business that's the key comp that we actually show in the presentation that we published yesterday How is Nutrient done just as a public market? Do people understand the value that it creates in the marketplace? Yeah So in the last year as we've talked about on the show companies that are in the fertilizer business are making money hand over fist because of the issues with the supply chain for natural gas, potash and phosphates and so if you have access to supply like Nutrient does and various other fertilizer companies do you are absolutely minting money this year and so they're having record earnings right now and people are kind of estimating that the fertilizer market will kind of reset and as a result these companies are over earning right now which means that they're getting low forward multiples but generally speaking these businesses have done very well and one of the US is about 15 years ahead of Latin America and remember Latin America produces and exports more calories than the US and corn farmers in Brazil for example are only getting half the yield of corn farmers in America, or a little more than half per acre, yield per acre and the reason is the retailers in the US are so sophisticated that they're introducing services and they make a bunch of money selling services now that wasn't the case 20 years ago and they're offering farmers advice using software and other kind of custom soil testing services and what not and that's really changed agriculture it's given farmers data that they didn't have before and help them make better decisions using that data that didn't exist before and that's really I would say concentrated in the US that kind of sophisticated behavior I think it's really important we see it happen around the world now because we need to grow more food and we need to do it without expanding land and acreage and so on and then we need to grow more sustainably which is another key part of this Did you worry a lot about the FX risk of all these inputs coming into Brazil, having to deal with local currency then having to kind of get the revenues out into US dollars and all of that stuff how did you think about that Yeah it's a good question So when all ag commodities around the world most commodities they trade in dollars and so if the dollar strengthens against the local currency the REI the farmers actually make more money and the input companies charge more money in local currency so basically the entire ag market and around the world commodity markets generally speaking inputs and outputs trade in dollars and so if you're a local business you actually make more money when your local currency goes down and you're willing to spend more money and so businesses in a commodity cyclical business generally are currency hedged because of that because they're selling stuff in dollars and then as a result the places that they're buying stuff from charge them more in their local currency and they can still make a good spread so you know there may be fluctuations in FX risk but generally speaking I think we see and I'm just speaking generally here not about this particular transaction we generally see and we saw this at Monsanto so that's a good example all ag input companies when the local currencies devalue in a market that they're selling into they charge more and the farmers can afford to pay more because they're making more selling their product into the markets I think this company is super interesting so I'm rooting for you it looks really cool and it seems like a very good entry valuation, good margin of safety too yeah 1.2

billion dollar valuation if I'm reading correctly here so yeah congratulations hard to get a deal done at this time for people who don't know FX for an exchange just trading one dollar or one currency for another Did you guys see that there was a Title 6 lawsuit filed against Pfizer for some you know in the Civil Rights Act there's something called Title 6 which means that if you take federal funds of any kind you can't discriminate and Pfizer has a program to recruit African American and Latino people into the company and they're not being sued because you know Pfizer takes NIH grants they work with the US government they work with Medicare, they work with Medicaid and so as a result of that it's really happening one month before something else that we talked about which is there's the affirmative action case that's going to the Supreme Court where I think it's Harvard actually you know I think it's going to be a huge people pushing back on Harvard's ability to have some form of race based admissions so I just don't know if you guys were monitoring this for me I just took a step back and I thought look at what has happened legislatively in 2022 we basically repealed Roe v Wade the Supreme Court also went after a concealed carry in New York and said that New York cannot legislate against concealed carry big ramifications with respect to gun laws the consensus opinion is that we're going to repeal affirmative action in the next month or the Supreme Court is going to do that these are three pieces of an enormous change in the United States civil society that has happened in a really small condensed period of time so I have these thoughts on affirmative action but my other thought is like it's incredible how conservatives have been able to organize and how disorganized progressive have been in order to create a counter maneuver against them because this has been a systematic effort since Carl Rove literally wrote about it in the mid 2000s and here's what we're going to do we're going to raise a bunch of money we're going to redistrict everything we're going to get the state legislators on our side we're going to basically fund the federalist society and they did it and in 20 years they've created an enormous amount of change that I'm not sure all Americans agree with but meanwhile the progressives are just kind of like naval gazing at each other I mean and then you left off this past week Chamath that it seems like the gay marriage bill is going to be put to a vote and that they're not going to be able to find I didn't see that what? yeah yeah and Ted Cruz said he's not going to vote for it because it's attacking religious freedom so we had talked on a previous episode and I think Saxu said you didn't think gay marriage would come up and well no if I had to guess what the political gamesmanship is here because they think it's not going to pass they want to bring it up for a vote because it preserves the issue it intensifies the wedge issue when it look like they had enough votes they weren't going to put it up for a vote so I don't know I think there's a lot of gamesmanship here look I think enough Republican should vote for this just to pass it I don't think that well I think there's some issues with the way the bill is written in terms of maybe requiring religious organizations to perform gay marriages I think that somebody should just make an amendment to clarify that's not the case to solve this religious freedom issue I think if that happened then you get more Republicans on board or at least it wouldn't have an excuse but yeah look I would like to see enough Republicans vote for this to take it off the issue I don't think gay marriage is at any risk of being overturned by the Supreme Court remember it was Gorsuch who wrote that opinion so I think this is a scare tactic that progressives are able to use to fundraise off you know their base nonetheless it'd be nice if enough Republicans would vote to canonize marriage equality so that they wouldn't be able to do that that's the smart play here for Republicans yeah it looks like by the way breaking news in the Washington Post Democrats have postponed the same sex marriage vote until after the midterms so but I mean you can understand why people are going to be nervous about this after um they want to run on it as an issue they want to have that as an issue I mean I mean Republican move force it the 70% of people are in favor right 80% if Republicans want to be smart find 10 Republicans in the Senate who can support this and now it's now that you're going to support it come on Republicans have a brain don't let them change the issue from this economy that's spiraling out of control I mean Republicans are clueless what do you guys think is going on there oh yeah so FedEx stock has dropped as much as 25% as we're taping this this Friday after the CEO after a little I don't know if you saw the video I sent to the group chat but Kramer Jim Kramer was kind of pushing him do you think this recession do you think this recession he finally said yes I think there's a global recession they missed on revenue and they have cut their predictions for next year severely and the stocks way down I think based on what I heard on CNBC from reading some stories right before this breaking news is happening some people think this is 6040 market versus management but either way I think the Fed's interest rates are doing their job and less packages are being shipped because people are you would think spending less money and that was the whole point of this exercise was to slow the economy down free bird I think this is a little bit of a scratcher this is a new CEO so I think the game theory on this is that it made a lot of sense for him to reset expectations I get that and I think that that's a that's a reasonably smart thing to do when you're incoming leader of a very complicated organization that really is at the end of the bullwhip so to speak on consumer demand the problem is there's just so much conflicting data retail sales was pretty reasonable you know China actually looked a little bit stronger than people expected just this past week on some data that came out there it looks like Europe is going to really draw a hard line and make sure that they spent whatever it takes to have enough energy so that their productivity doesn't fall off a cliff all of those signals would say that you know we're not at the precipice of this kind of like cratering of demand and then you have Powell basically saying yeah we're going to go another 75 and you know we're going to take rates to probably somewhere between 4 and 5% so the the FedEx data point was pretty starkly in contrast with at least some of the data that we've seen over the last few weeks so I don't know it was a bit of a head scratcher they got three things working against them number one Amazon just continues to build out local delivery infrastructure at an incredible pace at the end of 2020 Amazon was already up to 25% market share which put them ahead of both FedEx and UPS and FedEx has seen their market share decline for the past 8 or 9 years now so that's kind of you know a key point number two is people are just shipping less stuff doing more stuff digitally and number three is this recession impact where they obviously have key economic indicators that allow them to do a better job forecasting deliveries than most companies I would imagine and so they can see order volume and trading volume and use that as a predictor for what volume for shipping is going to be in the future and I would guess that all three continue to work against them it's not like they have a lot of diversification in the business and other ways to expand out into so you've got a key vertically integrated player namely Amazon that is investing heavily to replace whatever they use you for I think as of a few years ago Amazon was only like 2% or 3% of FedEx's revenue anyway but still I would imagine Amazon is playing a key role here your first comment to me is now that sounds like the most credible explanation and to blame a recession is sort of a little bit of hiding the cheese it's probably fair to say that their lunch is getting eaten by Amazon so I can understand why FedEx is under a lot of pressure because of that if you just compare it to just all the other data it doesn't seem like this whole thing makes any sense what you just said about competition makes to me a lot more sense and yeah, competition with digital and Amazon digital, how much do you guys sign letters today versus eSign and I'm giving an example maybe that's a 1% impact and there's probably a few more things and these things all layer up well they could be losing market share while still growing because eCommerce is growing so violently in the world but Sacks what do you think? I think what's going on here is that whatever the issues of FedEx and no matter how overstated these warnings may have been I think they're directionally correct he's saying that the world's headed for a global recession and directionally he appears to be right I mean things look really grim we just had this inflation report that was much worse than what people were expecting inflation was supposed to go down to 8.0%

and actually it was 8.3% that's why the stock market cratered a few days ago it was like the worst day in the stock market I think maybe all year certainly since June we're almost towards the June lows now this FedEx executive is saying we're headed for global recession so it seems to me that the economic news is just pretty grim here and we're in a state of inflation the Fed has to keep raising interest rates at the same time that we have persistent high chronic inflation and you have to wonder I tweeted a few months ago that the White House economic advisor Brian Deese he said that in this interview with CNN that the Biden administration was willing to endure a global recession in order to keep Russia from controlling the Donbas region in Ukraine well mission accomplished it looks like it's getting its wish the administration has made some progress in the Donbas but we are also having a global recession what percentage of the recession inflation has to do with the Russian invasion of Ukraine I think it's meaningful we know it's a huge exacerbator of all these problems listen I don't think the economy is going to get better with the risk of war 3 hanging over our heads how does that work yeah but what percent of the economic issue do you think is percentage wise impact I don't think we're in a recession maybe you answer I don't think we're in a recession yet retail sales is still quite strong there's just a lot of signals that tell us that people are still consuming a lot of things jobs too and that GDP is pretty reasonable and that jobs and wages are pretty much quite full so I think sacks you are right that we will be there because you can only bring rates up so high until you break things do you see there's a tweet by I think a Charles Schwab analyst today about that issue of wages and she was tweeting off to find it that for the second year in a row we now have because of inflation we now have real wage decreases so you may be right about like where things stand today but this is about the trajectory right now of the economy and the trajectory is not good inflation is not coming down as fast as people were anticipating it's worse than expected you have the situation Ukraine where listen we can all cheer on the Ukrainians for this counteroffensive that appear to be successful but we are playing with fire over there I mean I don't recall a time during the Cold War where we did anything remotely this risky you have America listen we have American generals American generals we're taking credit for this counteroffensive do you see this New York Times story where they talk about the inside moment of this Ukraine counteroffensive so you now have America America is now giving Ukraine more and more advanced weapons okay this sort of the the long range artillery they're telling them where to point the weapons they're giving them the intelligence for it they're training them on how to use it they've got commanders on the ground there and and they actually are hand correcting the battle plans the Ukrainians had a counteroffensive plan the Americans said that's not good enough and they rewrote it so the Americans are now doing everything in this war except pulling the triggers and taking the bullets and I don't want to minimize the sacrifice the Ukrainians are making because they are dying in huge numbers and you know we can all respect and admire the sacrifice they're making for their own country but this is a very risky strategy for the United States of America to be pursuing I mean we are we are basically playing with fire in we are you know this close to being a war with a nuclear armed Russia and we never came close to this type of behavior during the Cold War and I don't understand what's changed so much that we have to take this kind of risk now at the beginning of this conflict I said that I was open to arming the Ukrainians under Cold War rules Cold War rules meaning covertly like we did in Afghanistan we now have multiple examples the administration boasting and taking credit taking credit for the counteroffensive for the sinking of the Mosva for killing Russian generals this seems very risky to me so Saks a court premise of the discussions we've had here is that the United States screwed up the negotiation with Putin by not taking NATO off the table Reuters reported that Putin rejected a Ukrainian peace deal at the start of the war at the start of the war Russian chief envoy on Ukraine told Putin that a provisional deal with Kiev had been struck deal would have satisfied Russia's demand that Ukraine stay out of NATO two of three sources said the push to get a deal finalized occurred immediately after Russia's February 24 invasion does that change any of your thinking on what's happened here and Putin's culpability? I think it's a data point you know but let me explain why I don't think it's just positive and by the way I saw the article every neocon on Twitter was basically tweeting that's trying to prove that this this is proven the whole near Shimer analysis let me tell you why it doesn't okay first of all if you read the article closely this offer did not come until after the invasion started okay and we already knew Zelensky was publicly saying in the early weeks of the war that they were willing to take Ukraine off the NATO off the table so this isn't that much news it happened after the other key point here is I know it didn't happen too late but also the offer did not come from the Americans this is a really important point to understand about the Russian position on this and I'm just saying this based on all their public pronouncements the Russians made an ultimatum in December and then Lavrov negotiated with Lincoln in January they were absolutely insistent that they would accept nothing less but a written guarantee from Washington why is that well the written guarantee was necessary because they've always claimed that James Baker Eukard Gorbachev over you know German reunification and not one inch eastward so they've always demanded a written assurance from the Americans and the reason they wanted from America and not Europe is because they know that Europe are America's poodles and Ukraine is a client state of America so listen they wanted a written guarantee from America before the war started they never got that now if your point is to Putin do everything he could to avoid this war absolutely not I will absolutely grant you that but we already knew that the question is did the US State Department do everything they could to avoid this war and my point is absolutely not they should have taken this Ukraine issue off the table in writing before the invasion got it okay and Fred talking about Ukraine no I just it was major news and we have an obligation I think to I'm glad to yeah we have an obligation to listen people are taking this one article on this one day they're uh I think I want to talk about it because listen I've seen it all over twitter that people take this one article and they're like see there's nothing to this war giving you the opportunity sacks now let me ask another question for freeberg freeberg the other follow up people would like us to have made here is we predicted famine and massive disruption in food we debated that here you were pretty clear that this was going to be or could be disastrous it hasn't turned out to be disastrous yet what's the update on you know fertilizer is shipping not shipping are we going to have global famine are we not going to have global famine what's the update there based on this conflict yeah we have a massive starvation problem the UN told told everyone I mean no one writes about this stuff because it's seemingly not interesting and mainstream which I don't friggin understand but the UN thinks that 345 million people now are incrementally marching towards starvation and so I think they did this at their meeting yesterday because of the war in the Ukraine so David Beasley whom I know well he's the executive director of the UN World Food Program he told the UN Security Council yesterday that 345 million people are now facing acute food insecurity in 82 countries where the UN operates which is 2.5

times the number of acutely food insecure people that existed before the pandemic hit and so this is creating like we talked about these rippling effect in terms of initially it was fertilizer cost which means less food is being produced locally then there was the acute crisis of getting food out of the Ukraine and now it's less planted acres and less yield getting out of those acres which we said was going to start to happen in the back half of this year and if you look at the price good proxy for this is the price for corn we're at near record highs for the last couple of years in terms of corn pricing the 2023 futures pricing for next December for corn is at 620 a bushel you know and it kind of peaked out right around the middle part of the Ukraine crisis in April at 673 so we're getting right back to that high point and so this is a major problem that's brewing and as I highlighted at the beginning of our talk today which I show in the presentation for the Lavoro Transaction that I talked about earlier we have done an incredible job building a resilient food supply and excellent global supply chains to feed people around the world going back 30 years and we've been able to steadily decrease the number of people that are food insecure or facing famine and famine in the UN definition is less than 1200 calories per day on average for a year and so we went from like a billion people around the world facing famine about 30 years ago and got that number all the way down to 600 million and then in the last 2.5

3 years it's shot back up to 800 million and now the UN thinks it's going to shoot up even more so we may even be retracing our way all the way back 30 years because of the crises that have enveloped the region around Ukraine and the resulting impact on fertilizer availability fertilizer pricing and so on and as I mentioned a few weeks ago many ammonia fertilizer plants which is nitrogen fertilizer the main kind of component of fertilizer in Europe are being shut down because they run on natural gas and so government agencies and the local producers are turning those plants off to make more natural gas available for heating Would you describe this Freiberg as because we are seeing the EU remember they made that decision By the way this is why South America is so important sorry go ahead Would you describe this though because the EU was also at the same time the UN was highlighting these concerns the EU was also praising the massive progress we made from Russia and Ukraine allowing fertilizer allowing exports and this resiliency being built up We got wheat moving and then we got some fertilizer exports moving So 2 steps forward, 1 step back would be how you describe this maybe Yeah, Nat gas prices are still elevated Nat gas availability in Europe is obviously a significantly restricted right now Will we get through it Do you think we can manage this Yeah, look, I don't know how many look, there's some number of people some number of tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions of people who are going to starve between here and there that otherwise weren't going to be starving By the way there's always some hundreds of millions as I mentioned of people around the world that are starving under 1200 calories a day and that number climbing some incremental amount that's an incremental 300, 400 million people that didn't need to starve and that's a condition we're now going to be facing and so people are like, yeah, yeah people are still eating, you know, there's still food around the world we don't pay much attention to these third world countries we don't pay much attention to these underdeveloped nations because we don't have press coverage there and when people are on the streets and unable to eat it doesn't seem to make everyday mainstream media coverage but it is happening and statistically it is a massive problem Yeah, we're doing a great job of covering Kanye and Kim but yeah maybe get some reporters to cover the people starving We've covered it and I appreciate you guys giving me a chance to talk about it because I think it's super important When this show is at its best I think we're highlighting things that other people are ignoring Listen, I just want to say on this Ukraine situation and this applies to this episode as well as all the previous ones I don't want to be right about this issue just like I'm sure Freeberg doesn't want to be right about famine coming true we don't want these things to happen If I could choose an outcome right now I would say it would be great if the Russian army collapsed because of its morale problem tucked its tail between its legs went back to Moscow and then the Ukrainians had the good sense to respect the rights of the Russian speakers living in the Donbass and Crimea and this whole thing basically tamped down and basically was over but look, I think there's an equal and opposite chance that doesn't happen that certainly could happen but I think there's an equal and opposite chance that instead what happens is that we climb the escalatory ladder that Putin, I think we are backing him into a corner everybody says that he cannot survive the loss of this war and yet we're not willing to give him an off ramp so what choice does he have but to escalate so what does that mean? It could mean a full mobilization of that country it could mean they resort if they can't achieve their aims by conventional weapons maybe they resort to unconventional weapons we don't know, this seems like a highly volatile risky situation and I just think that we the United States of America need to be thinking very clearly about what is in our interest because all I see is an identification we're so interested in helping and identifying with the Ukrainians that we've lost sight of an American interest that's separate and independent of Ukraine's desire for self termination I can understand and respect their nationalism and their patriotism but we are a different nation, we better think really carefully about our interests here David sometimes you're misinterpreted as this is a partisan issue for you you're a dove, you're David the dove I have a dove, you're David the dove you are a dove, not a hawk you want peace listen, I believe that if America is going to risk war with a nuclear armed power there better be a vital interest at stake otherwise we should find every diplomatic off ramp we can optimistic about our ability to navigate Shemath, the Ukraine situation the war in Ukraine famine supply disruption, energy do you think we'll get through all this? Are you optimistic? I think that rates are going to go somewhere between 4.5

to 5% I think Stan Druckenmiller is right and I've said this, I don't know, I'd nauseam so I'll just keep saying it but I think everybody has consistently been wrong and they have wanted inflation to be a transitory phenomenon that goes away and they've been consistently wrong even in our group chat we see these forecasts they've been utterly consistently wrong so rates are going to go higher than people expect it'll stay around longer than people want this will have an impact to the economy that impact in 2024, 2025 will not be that great so that's one thing if you want to focus on Ukraine for a second there's something that I think we should focus on which I read this interesting article about Russian mothers and in the 1980s when Russia was at war with Afghanistan there were these bodies that were sent home to Russia and these mothers got very very upset and they protested and then in 2000, early 2000s there was a nuclear submarine that basically got shot and sank and then Russian mothers protested in the Chechen war they are a group of individuals in Russia that have enormous organizing power it turns out and they they really can tell what the real temperature is on the ground what Putin has done so far is that he's largely recruited people from the Spartan communities inside of Central Russia and used third party contractors so he's minimized the risk of the real cohort of the Russian population who will really stand fervently against what's going on so until you see that happening those guys have a long way to go and I think that this thing is going to drag on for a really long time so it's a paid army therefore it's obscuring the impact on actual citizens in Russia it's half paid but the other half are from places where they're organizing power is limited and I think that that was Putin's you know calculation seeing what has happened before again sort of like the tip of the spear of these Russian mothers and we're not seeing that so that means that the ability for him to manage perception inside of Russia is apparently pretty good greater than people expected greater than people expected so this is going to go on for as long for much longer than people think so I would just prepare for this inevitable outcome and just kind of you know manage this another year of slogging it through a choppy waters might be one way to look at this I think that's a very good way to say it I think we're in a very volley choppy market for the foreseeable future yeah and therein lies some opportunities and also maybe some discipline in various markets one thing to just keep in mind where most people feel these rate hikes is in the 30 year fixed mortgage right this is where most Americans are going to feel it and if you look at the chart you know like this is a big jump up from our absolutely free money environment that most Americans were feeling doing you know what do they call it when you take out equity on your mortgage like a second mortgage or a credit line credit line most people were you know experiencing a lot of free money and upgrading their kitchens and taking money out of their homes yada yada but when you look at it historically you know even at 6% or even if it goes to 7% for mortgages it's a lot less than we our parents experienced and we experienced for the first half of our adult lives so I think it's surmountable and this number you don't think is going to get up to above 10% right the 30 year fixed you don't see that happening so I think it's manageable it's going to be choppy listen Saks didn't get to promote it but he has a wonderful film at the Toronto Film Festival about Dolly and he is doing an awesome Dolly experience with the AI that paints pictures and so we're just going to insert into the end of the program the beautiful work he's doing there and his Dolly film is supposed to be excellent it's the second film David is producing after thank you for smoking so congratulations to our own little Scorsese for the Sultan of Science the dictator and David the Dove the world's greatest moderator Jason Calichanas and we'll see you next time bye bye love you guys bye bye alright so I'm at the Dolly land exhibit here at the St.

Regis the St. Regis hotel was a very important hotel in Dolly's life we actually lived in the penthouse of the St. Regis in New York and the St. Regis hotel has very graciously agreed to host this exhibition for us and this exhibition is it's basically a rendering of Dolly Studio what Dolly Studio might have looked like and those works of art are actually generated by GPT3 the so called Dolly engine so thanks to the open AI team and Sam Altman for giving us access to Dolly DALL dash E and so fans can just come here and they can use these tablets to enter what art they want to create they can just enter terms and the engine will spit out art that is made not obviously by Salvador Dolly but it's in the style of Salvador Dolly so I thought this is a very cool way to commemorate the film we are premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival this weekend this is an independent movie I've had in development for something like a decade and the great actor Academy Award winning actor Ben Kaseley plays Dolly and gives a phenomenal performance so we're excited to premiere this movie show it to the world for the first time this weekend alright thanks for watching bye we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just like this sexual tension that we just need to release somehow what you're about to be what you're about to be what you're about to be we need to get merged I'm going Dolly I'm going Dolly
